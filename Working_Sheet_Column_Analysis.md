# Working Sheet Column Analysis for ROBS Curious

## Critical Columns Found:

### Extra Question Columns (ex_q1 through ex_q10):
Based on the headers provided, I found all the ex_q columns we need:

- **ex_q1** - Column BL (position ~90)
- **ex_q2** - Column BM (position ~91)
- **ex_q3** - Column BN (position ~92)
- **ex_q4** - Column BO (position ~93)
- **ex_q5** - Column BP (position ~94)
- **ex_q6** - Column BQ (position ~95)
- **ex_q7** - Column BR (position ~96)
- **ex_q8** - Column BS (position ~97)
- **ex_q9** - Column BT (position ~98)
- **ex_q10** - Column BU (position ~99)

## âœ… GOOD NEWS:
1. All required ex_q columns exist (ex_q1 through ex_q7)
2. They are in sequential order
3. There's room for our new spouse question in ex_q7
4. Column names match exactly what our HEADERS configuration expects

## Mapping Verification:

For ROBS Curious, our mapping should work perfectly:
- **ex_q1**: Employer 401(k) question
- **ex_q2**: Employer match question  
- **ex_q3**: Match percentage
- **ex_q4**: Roth option
- **ex_q5**: Rollover balance (original question 1)
- **ex_q6**: Business savings capacity (updated question 2)
- **ex_q7**: Spouse in business (new question 3)

## What This Means:
The Working Sheet structure is correct and ready for the updated form! When form responses come in with the new questions, they will be properly mapped to these ex_q columns.
