# Retirement Blueprint User Guide

## Welcome to Your Personalized Retirement Planning Journey

The Retirement Blueprint is an intelligent financial planning tool that creates a personalized retirement savings strategy just for you. By analyzing your unique circumstances, we'll help you optimize your savings across various investment vehicles while maximizing tax advantages and respecting contribution limits.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Initial Assessment (5-10 minutes)
We'll start by getting to know you through a brief questionnaire that covers:
- Basic information (age, employment status)
- Business ownership details (if applicable)
- Current retirement accounts
- Tax minimization priorities
- Retirement timeline and goals

**What happens next**: Based on your answers, we'll classify you into one of 9 specialized profiles and send you a personalized link for the next step.

### Step 2: Deep Dive Assessment (10-15 minutes)
Your personalized Phase 2 form will gather detailed information specific to your profile:
- Financial goal priorities (Retirement, Education, Health)
- Current account balances
- Monthly savings capacity
- Tax preferences (Traditional vs Roth)
- Profile-specific questions relevant to your situation

**What happens next**: Our allocation engine will process your information to create your optimal savings strategy.

### Step 3: Receive Your Blueprint
You'll receive a comprehensive allocation plan that includes:
- **Monthly allocation amounts** for each investment vehicle
- **Priority order** for funding accounts (maximizing employer matches and tax advantages)
- **Tax-optimized strategy** based on your preferences
- **Clear action steps** for implementation

3. Retirement accounts (based on tax preference)
4. Education savings (if applicable)
5. Additional retirement vehicles

## Frequently Asked Questions

The system enforces a minimum 20% savings rate to ensure adequate retirement preparation. This is based on financial planning best practices.

Start with what you can afford, prioritizing the vehicles in the order shown. Even partial implementation is better than none.

Review annually or when major life changes occur (job change, marriage, children, etc.).

### What about investment selection within accounts?
The blueprint focuses on optimal account allocation. Investment selection within accounts depends on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
