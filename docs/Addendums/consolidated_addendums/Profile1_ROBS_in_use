# Profile 1 — ROBS in Use: Instructional Addendum

## Introduction
This addendum translates your ROBS operating rules into a practical playbook. It supports your Retirement Blueprint by focusing on five areas you’ll manage every year: contributions, profit distributions, compensation, compliance controls, and exit planning. The aim is simple—maximize the unique growth power of a ROBS C-corporation while staying squarely within IRS/ERISA rules.

## 1) Contribution Optimization Strategies
**Your channels:** employee deferrals, employer match, employer profit sharing, and (the ROBS superpower) uncapped profit distributions to the plan.

- **Employee salary deferrals (W-2):** 2025 limits are $23,500 (under 50), $31,000 (50+), and $34,750 (60+). You can choose pre-tax or Roth. Set a standing deferral rate in payroll and use catch-ups when eligible.
- **Employer match (if offered):** Typical formulas match 100% of 3–6% of pay. Don’t leave free dollars unclaimed.
- **Employer profit sharing:** Up to **25% of W-2 compensation**; combined employee+employer total is **$70,000 for 2025** (before profit distributions). Often funded by the corporate tax return deadline.
- **Profit distributions to the 401(k):** **No statutory limit**; dividends must be paid **pro-rata** to all shareholders (including the plan) and documented.

**Planning cadence:**
- **Start of year:** Set deferral %, project compensation and profits, and build a contribution budget.
- **Quarterly:** Track YTD totals, assess distribution opportunities, adjust deferrals.
- **Year-end:** Fill remaining room (profit sharing), then execute final distributions.

**Age-based focus:** Use the $7,500 catch-up (50+) and the $11,250 “super catch-up” (60+) to accelerate savings in your highest-profit years.

**Pro-Rata Rule (Roth backdoor reality check):** If you or a spouse hold traditional IRA balances outside the plan, Roth conversions are subject to the pro-rata rule—rolling those IRAs into your ROBS 401(k) is generally prohibited. Common workarounds: multi-year conversions, spouse’s 401(k) rollover (if available), or pausing backdoor Roths and focusing on the ROBS plan during ownership years.

**Documentation to keep:** payroll deferral reports, board resolutions for employer contributions, distribution authorizations, and annual testing results.

## 2) Profit Distribution Planning
Profit distributions are your acceleration lever. Run the business for profitability and move surplus to the plan on a predictable schedule.

**When and how to distribute:**
- Use **quarterly reviews** to size distributions; perform a **year-end sweep** before fiscal close if cash allows. Maintain working capital and document the decision.
- Follow corporate formalities: determine distributable profits, convene the board, declare dividends, pay the 401(k) its percentage, record in corporate and plan books, and keep an audit trail.
- **Compliance guardrails:** pay **reasonable compensation first**, distribute **pro-rata** to all shareholders, and keep board resolutions and proof of payments.

**KPIs to monitor:** net margin, distribution yield, plan growth rate, and cumulative retirement funding vs. target.
