## Line-by-Line Instructions

### Part I - Nondeductible Contributions

**Line 1: Nondeductible contributions for 2024**
```
Enter current year nondeductible contributions
Example: Made $7,000 backdoor Roth contribution
Enter: 7,000
```

**Line 2: Total basis in traditional IRAs**
```
From prior year Form 8606, line 14
First year? Enter: 0
Example continuing: 0
```

**Line 3: Add lines 1 and 2**
```
Current + Prior basis = Total basis
Example: 7,000 + 0 = 7,000
```

**Lines 4-5: Skip if no distributions**
```
Only complete if took traditional IRA distributions
Not needed for conversions (use Part II)
```

**Line 6: Value of all traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs**
```
Total year-end balances (December 31)
Include ALL such accounts
Example: Only the $7,000 contributed = 7,000
```

**Lines 7-14: Complete only if took distributions**
```
Skip to Part II for conversions
These calculate basis in distributions
Will auto-populate if using software
```

### Part II - Roth Conversions

**Line 16: Conversions to Roth**
```
Total amount converted during year
From all 1099-R forms, box 1
Example: Converted the $7,000 = 7,000
```

**Line 17: Basis in conversions**
```
Complex calculation - follow instructions
For immediate conversion: Often equals contribution
Example: 7,000 (all basis)
```

**Line 18: Taxable amount**
```
Line 16 minus line 17
This goes to Form 1040
Example: 7,000 - 7,000 = 0 (tax-free!)
```
