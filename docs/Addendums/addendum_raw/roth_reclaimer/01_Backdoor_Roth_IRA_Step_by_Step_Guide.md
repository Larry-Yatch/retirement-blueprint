# Backdoor Roth IRA Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview
The backdoor Roth IRA strategy allows high-income earners to bypass income limits and contribute to a Roth IRA. This comprehensive guide walks you through every step, addresses common pitfalls, and ensures successful implementation.

## Pre-Implementation Assessment

### Check Your Eligibility
**2025 Roth IRA Income Limits:**
- Single: Phase-out begins at $146,000, complete at $161,000
- Married Filing Jointly: Phase-out begins at $230,000, complete at $240,000

**If your income exceeds these limits, the backdoor Roth is your solution.**

### Critical Pre-Check: Traditional IRA Balances
```
Traditional IRA: $_______
Rollover IRA: $_______
SEP-IRA: $_______
SIMPLE IRA: $_______
Total Pre-Tax IRA Money: $_______

If total > $0, you must address the pro-rata rule first!
```

## Step 1: Clear Traditional IRA Balances

### Why This Matters
The pro-rata rule taxes conversions proportionally based on pre-tax money across ALL your traditional IRAs. You cannot cherry-pick after-tax contributions.

### Solution Options

**Option A: Roll to Employer 401(k)**
```
Process:
1. Confirm employer plan accepts rollovers
2. Request direct rollover forms
3. Move all traditional IRA money
4. Verify $0 balance remains
Timeline: 2-4 weeks
```

**Option B: Roll to Solo 401(k)**
```
Requirements:
- Have self-employment income
- Establish Solo 401(k) first
- Plan must accept rollovers
- Complete before conversion
```

**Option C: Convert Everything to Roth**
```
Considerations:
- Large tax bill in current year
- Permanent solution
- May push into higher bracket
- Consider multi-year strategy
```

## Step 2: Open Required Accounts

### Traditional IRA Setup
**Provider Selection:**
- Major brokerages preferred (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab)
- Ensure no account fees
- Confirm easy conversion process
- Some providers offer same-day conversions

**Account Settings:**
- Choose money market as default investment
- Do NOT set up automatic investing
- Name it clearly (e.g., "Backdoor Traditional IRA")

### Roth IRA Setup
**If You Don't Have One:**
- Can be same or different provider
- Set up investment elections
- Prepare for receiving conversions
- Consider future investment strategy

## Step 3: Make Non-Deductible Contribution

### Contribution Process
**Timing:** Can contribute January 1 - April 15 (of following year)

**Amount for 2025:**
- Under 50: $7,000
- 50 and over: $8,000

**Critical Steps:**
1. Transfer money to traditional IRA
2. Leave in settlement/money market fund
3. Do NOT invest the money
4. Keep confirmation of contribution

### Documentation Required
```
CONTRIBUTION RECORD
Date: _______
Amount: $_______
Tax Year: _______
Account: _______
Confirmation #: _______
```

## Step 4: Convert to Roth IRA

### Optimal Timing
**Best Practice:** Convert immediately (same day if possible)
- Minimizes potential gains
- Simplifies tax reporting
- Avoids complications

**Acceptable:** Within same tax year
- Still relatively simple
- Minor gains possible

**Avoid:** Waiting until next tax year
- Complicates taxes
- Requires explanation
- Potential issues

### Conversion Process

**Online Conversion:**
1. Log into account
2. Select "Convert to Roth IRA"
3. Choose entire balance
4. Decline tax withholding (usually)
5. Confirm transaction
6. Save confirmation

**Phone Conversion:**
1. Call provider
2. Request Roth conversion
3. Provide account details
4. Decline withholding
5. Get confirmation number

### Tax Withholding Decision
**Generally Decline Because:**
- Non-deductible contribution = no tax due
- Withholding reduces Roth amount
- Pay any minimal tax from outside funds

## Step 5: Invest Roth Proceeds

### Investment Strategy
Once funds arrive in Roth:
- Invest according to long-term strategy
- Consider growth-oriented investments
- Tax-free growth forever
- No RMDs in your lifetime

### Common Allocations
```
Aggressive (20+ years):
- 90% stocks, 10% bonds
- Focus on growth

Moderate (10-20 years):
- 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Balanced approach

Conservative (<10 years):
- 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- Preservation focus
```

## Step 6: Tax Reporting (Critical!)

### Form 8606 Requirements
**Must File With Tax Return:**
- Reports non-deductible contribution
- Documents conversion
- Establishes basis
- Required every year you do backdoor

### Key Form 8606 Lines
```
Part I - Nondeductible Contributions
Line 1: Current year contribution
Line 2: Basis from prior years
Line 3: Total basis

Part II - Conversions
Line 16: Amount converted
Line 17: Basis in conversion
Line 18: Taxable amount (should be $0 or minimal)
```

### Common Tax Software Issues
**Problems to Watch:**
- Software may assume deduction
- May calculate tax incorrectly
- Override if necessary
- Consider professional preparation

## Year 2 and Beyond

### Annual Repetition
**Each Year:**
1. Verify no traditional IRA balances
2. Contribute to traditional IRA
3. Convert immediately
4. Invest in Roth
5. File Form 8606
6. Track basis

### Tracking Worksheet

## Special Situations

### Prior Year Contributions
```
Example: Contributing in March 2025

- Report on appropriate year's taxes
```

### State Tax Considerations
**Some States:**
- Don't tax conversions
- Have different rules
- May affect timing
- Research your state

Tax on $7,000 conversion: $6,510!
```
