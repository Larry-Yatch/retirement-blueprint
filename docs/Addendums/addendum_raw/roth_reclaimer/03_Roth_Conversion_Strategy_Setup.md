# Roth Conversion Strategy Setup Guide

## Overview
Strategic Roth conversions can transform your retirement by moving money from tax-deferred to tax-free growth. This guide helps you design and implement a conversion strategy tailored to your situation.

## Understanding Roth Conversions

### What Is a Roth Conversion?
- Moving money from traditional IRA to Roth IRA
- Pay taxes now on converted amount
- All future growth is tax-free
- No future RMDs on Roth IRAs
- Tax-free to heirs

### Why Convert?
**Tax Diversification**
- Hedge against future tax increases
- Flexibility in retirement
- Control your tax bracket
- Reduce RMDs later

**Estate Planning**
- Tax-free inheritance
- No RMDs for heirs
- Simplifies planning
- Maximizes legacy

## Conversion Strategy Framework

### Key Decision Factors

**1. Current vs. Future Tax Rates**
```
Current marginal rate: ____%
Expected retirement rate: ____%
If current < future: Convert more
If current > future: Convert less
If similar: Other factors decide
```

**2. Time Horizon**
- 20+ years: Aggressive conversion
- 10-20 years: Moderate approach  
- 5-10 years: Selective conversion
- <5 years: Limited benefit

**3. Available Cash for Taxes**
- Must pay taxes from outside funds
- Never use IRA money for taxes
- Consider estimated payments
- Plan cash flow carefully

### Tax Bracket Management

**2025 Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly):**
```
10%: $0 - $23,200
12%: $23,200 - $94,300
22%: $94,300 - $201,050
24%: $201,050 - $383,900
32%: $383,900 - $487,450
35%: $487,450 - $731,200
37%: $731,200+
```

**Bracket-Filling Strategy:**
```
Example:
Current taxable income: $150,000
Top of 22% bracket: $201,050
Room to convert at 22%: $51,050
```

## Conversion Strategies

### Strategy 1: Annual Bracket-Filling
**Approach:** Convert enough each year to fill current bracket

**Example Plan:**
```
Year 1: Convert $50,000 (fill 22% bracket)
Year 2: Convert $52,000 (adjusted for inflation)
Year 3: Convert $54,000
Continue until fully converted
```

**Best For:**
- Steady income earners
- Long time horizon
- Predictable tax situation
- Risk-averse investors

### Strategy 2: Opportunistic Conversions
**Approach:** Convert more in specific situations

**Trigger Events:**
- Low income year
- Market downturn
- Business loss
- Between jobs
- Early retirement years

**Example:**
```
Normal year: $300,000 income
Sabbatical year: $50,000 income
Opportunity: Convert $150,000 at lower rates
Tax saved: $20,000+
```

### Strategy 3: Systematic Multi-Year Plan
**Approach:** Convert entire IRA over set period

**5-Year Conversion Plan:**
```
IRA Balance: $500,000
Annual conversion: $100,000
Annual tax: ~$25,000
Total tax: $125,000
All future growth tax-free
```

**Considerations:**
- Spreads tax impact
- Predictable planning
- May miss opportunities
- Requires discipline

### Strategy 4: Retirement Gap Years
**Approach:** Heavy conversions between retirement and RMDs/Social Security

**Age 65-72 Window:**
```
Income sources: Minimal
Tax bracket: Low
Convert aggressively
Before Social Security starts
Before RMDs begin
Maximum tax efficiency
```

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Calculate Conversion Capacity

**Worksheet:**
```
Line 1: Expected AGI                    $_______

Line 3: Conversion capacity (2-1)      $_______
Line 4: State tax impact               $_______
Line 5: Net benefit analysis           $_______
```

### Step 2: Select Assets to Convert

**Best Assets to Convert:**
1. **Depressed values** - Market downturn

### Step 3: Execute Conversion

**Process Options:**

**Option A: Full IRA Conversion**
- Convert entire account
- Simplest process
- Highest tax impact

**Option B: Partial Conversion**
- Convert specific amount

- More flexible

**Option C: Asset-Specific**
- Convert certain holdings
- In-kind transfer
- Timing opportunities
- Complex tracking

### Step 4: Manage Tax Payment

**Estimated Tax Requirements:**
```
Conversion amount: $100,000
Tax rate: 24%
Federal tax due: $24,000
State tax: Varies
Total needed: ~$30,000

Payment options:
- Quarterly estimates

Market drop scenario:
IRA value January: $200,000
IRA value March: $160,000 (20% drop)
Convert in March: Same shares, 20% less tax
Recovery in Roth: Tax-free gains
```

### Technique 3: Charitable Offset

Roth conversion: $100,000
Taxable income increase: $100,000
