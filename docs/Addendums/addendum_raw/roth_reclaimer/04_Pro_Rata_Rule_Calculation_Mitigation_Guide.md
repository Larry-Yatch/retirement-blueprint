# Pro-Rata Rule Calculation & Mitigation Guide

## Overview
The pro-rata rule is the biggest obstacle to backdoor Roth IRA conversions. This guide explains how the rule works, provides detailed calculations, and offers strategies to mitigate or eliminate its impact.

## Understanding the Pro-Rata Rule

### What It Is
The IRS requires that any Roth conversion from a traditional IRA be done proportionally, considering ALL your traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as one combined account.

### Why It Matters
You cannot cherry-pick just after-tax contributions for tax-free conversion. The taxable percentage applies to any amount converted.

### The Formula
```
Tax-Free Percentage = Total Basis (After-Tax) ÷ Total IRA Balance
Taxable Percentage = Pre-Tax Balance ÷ Total IRA Balance
```

## Pro-Rata Calculations

### Example 1: Small Pre-Tax Balance
```
Traditional IRA (pre-tax): $10,000
New after-tax contribution: $7,000
Total IRA balance: $17,000

Pro-rata calculation:
- After-tax percentage: $7,000 ÷ $17,000 = 41.2%
- Pre-tax percentage: $10,000 ÷ $17,000 = 58.8%

Converting $7,000:
- Tax-free portion: $7,000 × 41.2% = $2,884
- Taxable portion: $7,000 × 58.8% = $4,116
- Tax due (24% bracket): $988
```

### Example 2: Large Pre-Tax Balance
```
Traditional IRA (pre-tax): $200,000
SEP-IRA: $100,000
New after-tax contribution: $7,000
Total IRA balance: $307,000

Pro-rata calculation:
- After-tax percentage: $7,000 ÷ $307,000 = 2.3%
- Pre-tax percentage: $300,000 ÷ $307,000 = 97.7%

Converting $7,000:
- Tax-free portion: $7,000 × 2.3% = $161
- Taxable portion: $7,000 × 97.7% = $6,839
- Tax due (24% bracket): $1,641
```

### Example 3: Multiple After-Tax Contributions
```
Traditional IRA (pre-tax): $50,000
Prior after-tax contributions: $15,000
New after-tax contribution: $7,000
Total IRA balance: $72,000

Pro-rata calculation:
- Total after-tax: $22,000
- After-tax percentage: $22,000 ÷ $72,000 = 30.6%
- Pre-tax percentage: $50,000 ÷ $72,000 = 69.4%

Converting $22,000:
- Tax-free portion: $22,000 × 30.6% = $6,732
- Taxable portion: $22,000 × 69.4% = $15,268
- Tax due (24% bracket): $3,664
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Complete IRA Liquidation

**Approach:** Roll all pre-tax IRA money to 401(k)

**Implementation:**
```
Step 1: Identify all IRA balances
- Traditional IRA: $_______
- Rollover IRA: $_______
- SEP-IRA: $_______
- SIMPLE IRA: $_______
Total: $_______

Step 2: Confirm 401(k) accepts rollovers
Step 3: Execute direct rollover
Step 4: Verify $0 IRA balance
Step 5: Begin backdoor Roth strategy
```

**Pros:**
- Complete elimination of pro-rata
- Clean slate for backdoor Roth
- Maintains tax deferral

**Cons:**
- Requires accepting 401(k) plan
- May limit investment options
- Could affect creditor protection

### Strategy 2: Strategic Timing

**Approach:** Time rollovers and conversions for maximum benefit

**December 31 Rule:**
```
The IRS snapshot date is December 31
Actions:
- December 29: Roll pre-tax to 401(k)
- December 31: $0 IRA balance
- January 2: Make new contribution
- January 3: Convert to Roth
Result: No pro-rata impact
```

**Pros:**
- Works with year-end timing
- No permanent changes needed
- Flexible approach

**Cons:**
- Narrow window
- Risk if timing fails
- Annual repetition needed

### Strategy 3: Isolation Strategy

**Approach:** Keep after-tax contributions separate

**Process:**
```
Option A: Convert immediately
- Make after-tax contribution
- Convert same day
- Minimize pre-tax mixing
- Reduces pro-rata impact

Option B: Separate account
- New IRA for after-tax only
- Still subject to aggregation
- But cleaner tracking
- Easier documentation
```

### Strategy 4: Mega Roth Conversion

**Approach:** Convert entire IRA balance to Roth

**Calculation Example:**
```
Total IRA balance: $150,000
After-tax basis: $20,000
Taxable amount: $130,000
Tax due (24% bracket): $31,200

Benefits:
- Eliminates pro-rata forever
- All future growth tax-free
- No more complications
- Clean backdoor Roth path
```

**Pros:**
- Permanent solution
- Maximum tax-free growth
- Simplifies future planning

**Cons:**
- Large current tax bill
- May push to higher bracket
- Requires cash for taxes

### Strategy 5: Gradual Conversion

**Approach:** Convert over multiple years to manage tax impact

**5-Year Plan Example:**
```
Starting balance: $200,000 pre-tax
Annual conversions: $40,000

Year 1: Convert $40,000, pay $9,600 tax
Year 2: Convert $40,000, pay $9,600 tax
Year 3: Convert $40,000, pay $9,600 tax
Year 4: Convert $40,000, pay $9,600 tax
Year 5: Convert $40,000, pay $9,600 tax

Total converted: $200,000
Total tax paid: $48,000
Pro-rata eliminated: Year 6
```

## Advanced Mitigation Techniques

### Solo 401(k) Solution

**For Self-Employed:**
```
1. Establish Solo 401(k)
2. Ensure accepts rollovers
3. Roll all IRAs to Solo 401(k)
4. Greater investment control
5. Still eliminates pro-rata
```

### Spouse Strategy

**If Married:**
```
Scenario: You have large IRA, spouse doesn't
Solution: Spouse does backdoor Roth
- Spouse contributes $7,000
- Spouse converts to Roth
- No pro-rata for spouse
- Family gains $7,000 annually
```

### QCD Alternative

**Age 70.5+ Option:**
```
Use Qualified Charitable Distributions
- Donate from IRA directly
- Reduces IRA balance
- Satisfies RMDs
- Improves pro-rata ratio
```
