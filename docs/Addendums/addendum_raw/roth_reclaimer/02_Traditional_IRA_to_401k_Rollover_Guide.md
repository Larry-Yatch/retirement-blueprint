# Traditional IRA to 401(k) Rollover Guide

## Overview
Rolling traditional IRA assets into a 401(k) plan clears the path for backdoor Roth IRA conversions by eliminating the pro-rata rule complications. This guide provides detailed instructions for successfully completing this critical step.

## Why Roll Traditional IRAs to 401(k)

### The Pro-Rata Problem
When you have pre-tax IRA money, any Roth conversion is taxed proportionally:
```
Example:
Traditional IRA balance: $100,000
Backdoor Roth attempt: $7,000
Result: $6,930 taxable (99% pre-tax ratio)
Defeats the purpose!
```

### The 401(k) Solution
- 401(k) balances don't count for pro-rata
- Clears IRA slate completely
- Enables clean backdoor Roth conversions
- Maintains tax-deferred growth

## Eligibility Requirements

### Your 401(k) Must Accept Rollovers
**Check Plan Features:**
- Review Summary Plan Description (SPD)
- Contact HR or plan administrator
- Look for "rollover contributions" section
- Confirm no waiting periods

**Common Restrictions:**
- Some plans don't accept rollovers
- May have employment duration requirements
- Could limit rollover sources
- Might restrict access to rolled funds

### IRA Types That Can Roll
✅ **Eligible:**
- Traditional IRA
- Rollover IRA
- SEP-IRA
- SIMPLE IRA (after 2 years)
- Non-deductible traditional IRA

❌ **Not Eligible:**
- Roth IRA
- Inherited IRA
- Required minimum distributions
- Substantially equal payments

## Pre-Rollover Checklist

### Document Everything
- [ ] Current IRA statements
- [ ] Cost basis records (Form 8606s)
- [ ] Account numbers
- [ ] 401(k) rollover forms
- [ ] Direct rollover authorization

### Identify After-Tax Amounts
```
Review all Form 8606s filed
Total non-deductible contributions: $_______
Previous conversions/distributions: $_______
Remaining basis: $_______
```

**Critical:** After-tax amounts need special handling

### Plan Timing
**Best Times:**
- Early in year (more time for backdoor Roth)
- After receiving all tax documents
- Before making current year contributions
- When market is stable

## Step-by-Step Rollover Process

### Step 1: Contact 401(k) Provider

**Information to Gather:**
1. Rollover acceptance confirmation
2. Required forms or online process
3. Processing timeline
4. Any restrictions or limitations
5. How funds will be coded

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Do you accept IRA rollovers?"
- "What documentation is required?"
- "How long does processing take?"
- "Are there any restrictions on rolled funds?"
- "Can I do this online?"

### Step 2: Separate After-Tax Money

**If You Have Basis:**
```
Option A: Leave Basis in IRA
- Roll only pre-tax portion
- Keep basis for conversion
- More complex tracking
- Allows immediate Roth conversion

Option B: Roll Everything
- Entire balance to 401(k)
- Lose ability to convert basis tax-free
- Simpler process
- Basis trapped until distribution
```

**Most Common:** Roll entire balance if basis is small

### Step 3: Initiate Direct Rollover

**Critical: Request DIRECT Rollover**
- Funds go directly to 401(k)
- No tax withholding
- No 60-day deadline
- No risk of mistakes

**Process Options:**
1. **Online Transfer**
   - Log into IRA provider
   - Select rollover option
   - Enter 401(k) details
   - Submit request

2. **Paper Forms**
   - Complete rollover request
   - Include 401(k) account info
   - Mail or fax as directed
   - Keep copies

3. **Phone Request**

   - Follow up in writing

### Step 4: Provide 401(k) Information

**Required Details:**
```
401(k) Plan Name: _______
Plan Administrator: _______
Address: _______
Phone: _______
Your Account #: _______
FBO: [Your Name]
Tax ID: [Plan's EIN]
```

### Step 5: Monitor Transfer

## Special Situations

### Multiple IRAs
**Consolidation Strategy:**
```
IRA #1: $50,000
IRA #2: $30,000

Total: $100,000

Option 1: Roll each separately
Option 2: Consolidate first, then roll
Option 3: Roll all to same 401(k)
```

### SEP-IRA Considerations
**Active SEP:**
- Can still roll to 401(k)
- Keep account open for contributions
- Roll balance annually
- Maintains backdoor Roth option

### SIMPLE IRA Rules
**Two-Year Wait:**

- Track participation start date
- After 2 years, treat as traditional
- Roll entire balance

### Non-Spouse Inherited IRA
**Cannot Roll:**

- Keep separate always
- Doesn't affect pro-rata
- Different distribution rules

## Tax Reporting
