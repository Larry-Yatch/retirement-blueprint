# Backdoor Roth IRA Implementation Guide for Solo 401(k) Participants

## Overview
As a Solo 401(k) participant, you're likely earning too much to contribute directly to a Roth IRA. The backdoor Roth IRA strategy allows you to circumvent income limits legally. This guide provides step-by-step implementation instructions.

## Understanding the Backdoor Roth IRA

### What It Is
A two-step process that allows high-income earners to fund a Roth IRA:
1. Contribute to a traditional IRA (no income limits)
2. Convert the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (no income limits)

### Why It Works
- Traditional IRA contributions: No income limit for non-deductible contributions
- Roth conversions: No income restrictions since 2010
- Result: Legal pathway to Roth IRA regardless of income

### 2025 Income Limits (When Backdoor Needed)
**Roth IRA Direct Contribution Phase-Out:**
- Single: $146,000 - $161,000
- Married Filing Jointly: $230,000 - $240,000

If your Modified AGI exceeds the lower threshold, consider backdoor Roth.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Critical Requirements
- [ ] **No Traditional IRA Balances**: Or willing to address pro-rata rule
- [ ] **Solo 401(k) Established**: Can help with pro-rata rule
- [ ] **Tax Payment Ability**: For any taxable conversion
- [ ] **Record Keeping System**: For Form 8606 tracking
- [ ] **Understanding**: Of process and implications

### Pro-Rata Rule Check
**Calculate your exposure:**
```
Traditional IRA balances:        $_______
SEP-IRA balances:               $_______
SIMPLE IRA balances:            $_______
Rollover IRA balances:          $_______
Total pre-tax IRA assets:       $_______

If total > $0, see Pro-Rata Solutions section
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Open Accounts (If Needed)

**Traditional IRA**
- Choose same provider as Roth IRA
- Select "money market" as default
- Do NOT set up automatic investing
- Confirm no fees for conversion

**Roth IRA**
- Can be at different provider
- Set up investment elections
- Prepare for receiving conversion
- Enable electronic transfers

### Step 2: Make Non-Deductible Contribution

**Contribution Details:**
```
Contribution Limit (2025):       $7,000
Age 50+ Catch-up:               +$1,000
Total if 50+:                   $8,000
Deadline:                       April 15, 2026
```

**Process:**
1. Transfer money to traditional IRA
2. Leave in money market/settlement fund
3. Do NOT claim deduction on taxes
4. Keep contribution confirmation

### Step 3: Convert to Roth IRA

**Timing Considerations:**
- **Best**: Immediately after contribution
- **Good**: Within same tax year
- **Avoid**: Delaying to next year
- **Never**: Let it sit and grow

**Conversion Process:**
1. Request Roth conversion
2. Choose "convert entire balance"
3. Elect tax withholding (usually 0%)
4. Complete online or by phone
5. Confirm completion

### Step 4: Invest Roth Proceeds

**Once in Roth:**
- Invest according to strategy
- Consider growth investments
- Tax-free growth forever
- No RMDs in your lifetime

### Step 5: File Form 8606

**Required Reporting:**
- Part I: Non-deductible contributions
- Part II: Roth conversions
- Keep copy forever
- One form per person

## Pro-Rata Rule Solutions

### Understanding the Problem
If you have pre-tax IRA money, conversions are partially taxable:
```
Example:
Pre-tax IRA balance:            $45,000
New contribution:               $7,000
Total IRA assets:               $52,000
Pre-tax percentage:             86.5%
Tax on $7,000 conversion:       $6,055 worth
```

### Solution 1: Roll IRAs to Solo 401(k)

**Process:**
1. Confirm Solo 401(k) accepts rollovers
2. Request direct rollover
3. Move all pre-tax IRA money
4. Leave $0 balance
5. Then do backdoor Roth

**Timeline Example:**
- January: Roll IRA to Solo 401(k)
- February: Contribute to traditional IRA
- March: Convert to Roth IRA
- April: File taxes with Form 8606

### Solution 2: Roll to Employer 401(k)
If you have W-2 income:
- Check if plan accepts IRA rollovers
- Move traditional IRA balances
- Keep Roth IRAs separate
- Clear path for backdoor

### Solution 3: Convert Everything
**Nuclear option:**
- Convert all traditional IRAs to Roth
- Pay taxes on entire amount
