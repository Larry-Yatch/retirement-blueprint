# Employee Compliance Requirements for Solo 401(k)

## Overview
The "Solo" in Solo 401(k) means you can't have employees—except your spouse. This guide explains the compliance requirements, what happens when you hire employees, and how to maintain eligibility.

## Understanding Employee Restrictions

### Who Counts as an Employee?
**Included (Disqualifies Solo 401(k)):**
- W-2 employees (full or part-time)
- Anyone working 1,000+ hours/year
- Anyone over age 21 with 1+ year of service
- Common law employees
- Leased employees

**Excluded (Still Qualify):**
- Your spouse
- Independent contractors (1099)
- Partners in partnership
- Yourself as owner
- Employees under age 21
- Employees with <1 year service
- Employees working <1,000 hours/year

### The 1,000-Hour Rule
```
1,000 hours = approximately:
- 20 hours/week for 50 weeks
- 40 hours/week for 25 weeks
- 83 hours/month average

Track carefully - exceeding triggers requirements
```

## Spouse as Employee Rules

### Legitimate Employment Requirements
**Must Have:**
- Actual work performed
- Reasonable compensation
- Proper documentation
- Regular hours/duties
- Business necessity

**Can Include:**
- Administrative tasks
- Bookkeeping
- Marketing assistance
- Customer service
- Operations support

### Spouse Compensation Strategy
```
Example Business Income: $150,000

Option 1 - No Spouse Employment:
- Your contributions only: $51,571

Option 2 - Employ Spouse:
- Your salary: $75,000
- Spouse salary: $50,000
- Combined contributions: $74,000+
- Additional savings: $22,429
```

### Documentation for Spouse
**Required Records:**
- Employment agreement
- Job description
- Time records
- Payroll records
- W-2 forms
- Reasonable compensation study

## Independent Contractor Compliance

### Proper Classification Critical
**Independent Contractor Factors:**
1. **Behavioral Control**
   - Works independently
   - Sets own hours
   - Uses own methods
   - Not supervised directly

2. **Financial Control**
   - Has other clients
   - Provides own tools
   - Can make profit/loss
   - Invoices for services

3. **Relationship Type**
   - Project-based work
   - No employee benefits
   - Written contracts
   - Limited duration

### Documentation Requirements
**Keep on File:**
- Written contractor agreements
- 1099 forms issued
- Invoices received
- Proof of contractor's business
- Evidence of independence

### Red Flags to Avoid
❌ Contractor works only for you
❌ You control how work is done
❌ Set schedule required
❌ Long-term indefinite relationship
❌ Providing tools/workspace
