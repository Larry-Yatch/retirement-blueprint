# Advanced Business Owner Strategies Guide

## Overview
Sophisticated business owners can implement advanced retirement strategies that go beyond traditional qualified plans. These techniques—including non-qualified deferred compensation, executive benefits, and integrated planning—can provide additional tax advantages and retirement security when properly executed.

## Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)

### Understanding NQDC Basics
```
Key characteristics:
- Supplements qualified plan benefits
- No contribution or benefit limits
- Unfunded promise to pay
- Creditor risk exists
- Selective participation allowed

Strategic advantages:
- Unlimited deferral amounts
- Flexible payout options
- Executive retention tool
- Tax deferral benefits
- Estate planning integration
```

### NQDC Plan Design Options

#### Salary Reduction Plans
```
Employee chooses to defer:
Current salary or bonuses
Into future payment stream
Employer invests notionally

Example structure:
Defer $100,000 annual bonus
Invest in market-based account
Receive at retirement/separation
Tax deferred until distributed
```

#### Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs)
```
Employer-funded benefits:
Promise of future payments
Often offset qualified plan benefits
Retention and recruiting tool

Typical formula:
2% × final pay × years of service
Less: Social Security benefits
Less: Qualified plan benefits
Equals: SERP benefit
```

#### Excess Benefit Plans
```
