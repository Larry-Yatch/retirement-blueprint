# Multiple Plan Coordination Guide

## Overview
Business owners can dramatically increase retirement savings by layering multiple qualified plans together. When properly coordinated, combinations like 401(k) + Defined Benefit + Cash Balance can enable $300,000+ annual contributions. This guide shows how to design and manage multiple plan strategies.

## Understanding Plan Combination Benefits

### Why Multiple Plans?
```
Single plan limitations:
401(k) only: $31,000 maximum (age 50+)
DB plan only: High employee costs
Profit sharing only: 25% of payroll limit

Combined approach:
401(k): $31,000 (employee deferrals)
DB Plan: $200,000 (age-based)
Total: $231,000 annual contributions
Plus employer profit sharing possible
```

### Section 415 Coordination
```
IRS limits on total benefits:
Annual additions: $70,000 (or 100% of compensation)
Catch-up: Additional $7,500
Defined benefit: $280,000 annual benefit

Key insight:
DC and DB limits are separate
Can maximize both simultaneously
Professional calculation required
```

## Common Plan Combinations

### 401(k) + Defined Benefit
```
Most popular combination:
401(k): Employee deferrals + match
DB: Large employer contributions

Benefits:
- Maximum contribution limits
- Employee satisfaction (401(k))
- Owner bias (DB plan)
- Tax efficiency

Typical allocation:
Owner gets 60-80% of total benefits
Despite paying for all employees
Age-weighting is the key
```

### 401(k) + Cash Balance
```
Moderate approach:
401(k): $31,000 employee deferrals
Cash Balance: $100,000+ employer funded

Advantages:
- Lower employee costs than traditional DB
- Easier employee communication
- Predictable contribution patterns
- Good for moderate age spreads

When appropriate:
- Owner age 45-55
- Moderate demographics
- Employee relations priority
```

### 401(k) + Profit Sharing + DB
```
Triple threat combination:
401(k): $31,000 (deferrals)
Profit Sharing: Variable (up to 25%)
DB: $200,000+ (age-based)

Maximum flexibility:
- Required contributions (DB)
- Variable contributions (profit sharing)
- Employee deferrals (401(k))
- Ultimate tax planning tool
```

### Cash Balance + Profit Sharing
```
Hybrid strategy:
Cash Balance: Predictable contributions
Profit Sharing: Flexible additions

Benefits:
- Lower base costs than traditional DB
- Variable profit sharing layer
- Employee understanding
- Owner bias potential

Design considerations:
- Cross-testing coordination
- Nondiscrimination complexity
- Professional management essential
```

## Design Strategies

### Sequential Implementation
```
Year 1-2: 401(k) with match
- Establish employee participation
- Build administrative capability
- Test employee acceptance

Year 3-4: Add profit sharing
- Increase contribution limits
- Variable cost structure
- Age-weight if possible

Year 5+: Add defined benefit
- Maximum contribution limits
- Full employee buy-in achieved
- Administrative systems proven
```

### Integrated Design Approach
```
Offset provisions:
DB plan credits 401(k) contributions
Reduces duplication of benefits
Maximizes total deduction

Example integration:
DB benefit = Formula - 401(k) account balance
Results in precise benefit coordination
Requires sophisticated actuarial work
```

### Cross-Testing Optimization
```
Test all plans together:
Convert contributions to benefit equivalents
Age-weight across all plans
Maximize owner favoritism legally

Professional requirements:
- Enrolled actuary
- Specialized software
- Annual recalculation
- Complex but powerful
```

## Administrative Coordination

### Record Keeping Systems
```
Integrated administration:
Single TPA for all plans
Coordinated participant statements
Unified compliance testing
Streamlined reporting

Benefits:
- Lower total costs
- Better coordination
- Reduced errors
- Single point of contact

Challenges:
- Limited provider options
- Higher complexity
- Professional expertise required
```

### Compliance Coordination
```
Unified testing approach:
- Combined ADP/ACP testing
- Coordinated coverage testing  
- Section 415 limit monitoring
- Integrated Form 5500 filing

Key requirements:
- Same plan year for all plans
- Consistent eligibility rules
- Coordinated vesting schedules
- Professional oversight essential
```

### Investment Coordination
```
Fiduciary considerations:
- Same investment committee
- Coordinated investment policy
- Unified asset allocation
- Combined fee negotiations

Strategic benefits:
- Economies of scale
- Simplified oversight
- Reduced fiduciary risk
- Professional management
```

## Financial Analysis Framework

### Cost-Benefit Modeling
```
Component analysis:
401(k) employee cost: $X
401(k) owner benefit: $Y
DB employee cost: $A
DB owner benefit: $B
Total employee cost: $X + $A
Total owner benefit: $Y + $B
Net owner benefit: $(Y+B) - (X+A)
```

### Cash Flow Planning
```
Contribution timing coordination:
401(k): Payroll deductions (ongoing)
DB: Annual lump sum (flexibility)
Profit Sharing: Discretionary (cash flow)

Planning benefits:
- Spread cash requirements
- Optimize tax timing
- Manage business cycles
- Maintain flexibility
```

### Tax Optimization
```
Deduction coordination:
Maximum 401(k) deduction: $31,000
DB contribution deduction: $200,000+
Profit sharing deduction: 25% of payroll
Total potential: $300,000+ deductions

Tax savings (37% bracket): $111,000+
After employee costs: $75,000+ net savings
ROI analysis: Usually strongly positive
```
