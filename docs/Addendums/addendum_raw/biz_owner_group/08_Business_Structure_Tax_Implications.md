# Business Structure Tax Implications Guide

## Overview
Your business entity type—Sole Proprietorship, S-Corp, C-Corp, Partnership, or LLC—dramatically affects retirement plan options, contribution limits, and tax benefits. Understanding these implications helps optimize both business structure and retirement planning strategies.

## Entity Types and Retirement Plan Impact

### Sole Proprietorship
```
Tax characteristics:
- Schedule C income
- Self-employment tax on all profits
- No separate entity
- Simple tax filing

Retirement plan implications:
- Solo 401(k) available
- SEP-IRA option
- SIMPLE IRA possible
- Contribution based on net SE income
- Self-employment tax reduces contributions

Maximum contributions limited by:
- Net self-employment income
- Self-employment tax deduction
- 25%/20% contribution limits
```

### Single-Member LLC (Disregarded Entity)
```
Tax treatment:
- Same as sole proprietorship
- Schedule C reporting
- Self-employment tax on all income
- Limited liability protection

Retirement plan options:
- Identical to sole proprietorship
- Solo 401(k) most common
- Can elect corporate taxation

Key insight:
Legal protection without tax changes
Same contribution limitations
Consider tax election for optimization
```

### S-Corporation
```
Tax structure:
- Pass-through taxation
- Reasonable salary required (W-2)
- Distributions not subject to SE tax
- Employment taxes only on wages

Retirement plan advantages:
- Group plans available (if employees)
- Solo 401(k) if owner-only
- Contributions based on W-2 wages
- Self-employment tax savings

Strategic considerations:
- Salary optimization for contributions
- Employment tax vs. contribution balance
- QBI deduction impact
```

### C-Corporation
```
Tax characteristics:
- Double taxation potential
- Corporate deduction for contributions
- Employee status for owner
- W-2 wages required

Retirement plan benefits:
- Highest contribution limits
- Best discrimination testing
- Corporate deduction valuable
- Employee benefits deductible

Unique opportunities:
- ROBS transactions possible
- Defined benefit plans optimal
- No owner percentage limits
- Professional management structure
```

### Partnership/Multi-Member LLC
```
Tax treatment:
- Pass-through to partners
- Self-employment tax complications
- K-1 reporting
- Guaranteed payments possible

Retirement plan considerations:
- Partners are self-employed
- Limited partner exceptions
- Contribution calculation complexity
- Professional guidance essential

Challenges:
- Multiple owner coordination
- Compensation determination
- Allocation formula complexity
```

## Self-Employment Tax Implications

### Understanding SE Tax Impact
```
SE tax rates (2025):
Social Security: 12.4% on first $168,600
Medicare: 2.9% on all income
Additional Medicare: 0.9% over $200,000/$250,000

Retirement plan interaction:
SE tax reduces contribution base
Deduction for employer SE tax portion
Net SE income affects limits

Example calculation:
Gross SE income: $100,000
SE tax: $14,130
SE tax deduction: $7,065
Net SE income: $92,935
Max contribution base: $74,348 (20%)
```

### Entity Structure Solutions
```
S-Corp election benefits:
Convert SE income to W-2 + distributions
Eliminate SE tax on distributions
Optimize salary/distribution mix

Example optimization:
Sole Prop: $100k income, $14k SE tax
S-Corp: $60k salary, $40k distribution
SE tax savings: $6k annually
Reinvest in retirement contributions
```

## Contribution Calculation Differences

### Self-Employed (Schedule C)
```
Contribution limit calculation:
Net SE income: $100,000
Less: Deductible SE tax (7.65%): $7,650
Net earnings: $92,350

Maximum contribution:
$92,350 × 20% = $18,470
OR $92,350 × 25% = $23,088 if using
   contribution as denominator method

Key: Lower effective rate due to SE tax
```

### S-Corporation Owner
```
W-2 wages: $80,000
Distributions: $30,000
Total income: $110,000

Retirement contribution base: $80,000 (W-2 only)
Maximum 401(k) deferral: $23,500
Employer contribution: 25% × $80,000 = $20,000
Total possible: $43,500

Advantage: No SE tax on distributions
Limitation: Contributions only on wages
```

### C-Corporation Owner
```
W-2 wages: $150,000
Corporate profits: Retained or distributed

Retirement contribution base: $150,000
Maximum 401(k): $23,500 + $7,500 catch-up
Employer contribution: Up to $46,000
Total possible: $77,000

Plus: Potential DB plan on top
Corporate deduction: Full amount
Double taxation: On distributions only
```

## Reasonable Compensation Requirements

### S-Corporation Standards
```
IRS guidelines:
Must pay reasonable salary for services
Market rate for similar positions
Geographic and industry adjustments
Consider total compensation package

Factors considered:
- Duties and responsibilities
- Time devoted to business
- Skills and expertise required
- Compensation history
- Business profitability

Planning strategy:
Balance SE tax savings with contribution limits
Higher salary = higher contributions
Lower salary = SE tax savings
Optimize total after-tax benefit
```

### Audit Risk Management
```
Red flags for IRS attention:
- Very low salary relative to distributions
- No salary for working owner
- Inconsistent compensation patterns
- Industry norms significantly exceeded

Safe harbor approaches:
- 60/40 salary/distribution split
- Market rate salary analysis
- Document compensation decisions
- Professional consultation

Documentation requirements:
- Board resolutions
- Compensation studies
- Market rate analysis
- Business justification
```

## QBI Deduction Coordination

### Section 199A Impact
```
QBI deduction benefits:
Up to 20% deduction on business income
Phases out at higher income levels
Affected by W-2 wages and assets

Interaction with retirement contributions:
Traditional contributions: Reduce AGI, preserve QBI
Roth contributions: No AGI reduction
SEP/SIMPLE: Business deduction, affects QBI base

Strategic planning:
Optimize contribution type for QBI benefit
Consider multi-year planning
Professional calculation required
```

### Income Threshold Management
```
2025 QBI phase-out ranges:
Single: $191,950 - $241,950
Married: $383,900 - $483,900

Planning opportunities:
Traditional contributions reduce income
Keep below phase-out thresholds
Maximize QBI deduction value
Coordinate with retirement goals

Example optimization:
Income: $200,000 (single)
Traditional 401(k): $23,500
Keeps income under threshold
QBI deduction: $35,300 (20% × $176,500)
Additional tax savings: ~$8,472
```

## Entity Selection for Retirement Planning

### Decision Matrix
```
Factors to consider:
□ Current income level
□ Number of employees
□ Retirement contribution goals
□ Tax bracket management
□ Administrative complexity tolerance

Scoring system:
Solo 401(k) needs: +2 for sole prop/SMLLC
High contributions: +3 for C-Corp
SE tax concern: +2 for S-Corp
Simplicity: +1 for sole prop
Flexibility: +2 for LLC
```

### Evolution Strategy
```
Business lifecycle approach:
Start-up: Sole prop/LLC (simplicity)

Maturity: C-Corp (maximum benefits)
Exit: Structure for succession

Timing considerations:
