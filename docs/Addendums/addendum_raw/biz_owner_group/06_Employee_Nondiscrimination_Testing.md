# Employee Nondiscrimination Testing Guide

## Overview
Business owners with group retirement plans must navigate complex nondiscrimination testing to ensure their plans don't unfairly favor highly compensated employees. Understanding these tests is crucial for maximizing owner benefits while maintaining plan compliance and avoiding costly corrections.

## Understanding Nondiscrimination Requirements

### Why Testing Exists
```
IRS policy objectives:
- Prevent tax benefits going only to owners/executives
- Ensure meaningful benefits for rank-and-file
- Maintain qualified plan tax advantages
- Balance business flexibility with fairness

Without testing:
Owners could contribute maximum amounts
Employees could get minimal benefits
Tax code would subsidize executive compensation
```

### Key Testing Categories
```
Coverage Tests:
- Do enough employees participate?
- Are benefit opportunities fair?

Contribution/Benefit Tests:
- Are contribution rates reasonable?
- Do benefits favor highly compensated employees?

Other Tests:
- Top-heavy testing
- Compensation limits
- Minimum participation requirements
```

## Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) Definition

### 2025 HCE Thresholds
```
Highly Compensated Employee:
- Earned over $155,000 in prior year
- OR owned more than 5% of business
- OR in top 20% of employees by pay (optional)

Key insight:
HCE status drives most testing
Determines which group owner falls into
Affects allowable contribution rates
```

### Family Attribution Rules
```
Ownership attribution:
Spouse: 100% attribution
Children under 21: 100% attribution
Parents: 50% attribution
Other family: Various percentages

Impact:
Family members may be HCEs
Even with modest compensation
Creates testing challenges
Requires strategic planning
```

## Coverage Testing

### Ratio Percentage Test
```
Participation comparison:
HCE participation rate: _____%
NHCE participation rate: _____%
Ratio: NHCE ÷ HCE = _____%

Passing standard: 70% or higher

Example:
HCEs: 2 out of 2 eligible = 100%
NHCEs: 7 out of 12 eligible = 58%
Ratio: 58% ÷ 100% = 58% (FAILS)
```

### Average Deferral Percentage (ADP) Test
```
For 401(k) employee deferrals:
Compares deferral rates by group

HCE average deferral: _____%
NHCE average deferral: _____%

Passing standards:
- HCE rate ≤ NHCE rate × 1.25
- OR HCE rate ≤ NHCE rate + 2%

Example that passes:
NHCEs average: 4%
HCEs can defer: 6% (4% × 1.5)
```

### Average Contribution Percentage (ACP) Test
```
For matching and after-tax contributions:
Same methodology as ADP
Separate test with same limits

Common issue:
Owner gets large match
Employees get small match
Test failure likely without safe harbor
```

## Advanced Testing Methods

### Cross-Testing
```
Converts contributions to benefits:
Uses actuarial calculations
Projects to normal retirement age
Compares equivalent benefit rates

Advantage:
Allows age-weighted allocations
Older owners get higher "equivalent" rates
Passes testing with proper design
Professional actuarial services required
```

### Gateway Test
```
Minimum allocation requirement:
Each NHCE must receive:
Lesser of 5% of compensation
OR 1/3 of highest HCE rate

Example:
Highest HCE gets 15%
Gateway: 5% (lesser of 5% or 15%÷3)
All NHCEs must get at least 5%
```

### General Test vs. Safe Harbor
```
General Test:
- Complex calculations
- Annual uncertainty
- Risk of failure
- Potential corrections

Safe Harbor:
- Guaranteed pass
- Known costs upfront
- 3% non-elective or enhanced match
- No annual testing required
```

## Common Testing Failures and Solutions

### ADP/ACP Test Failures

#### Excess Contribution Corrections
```
When HCEs defer too much:
1. Calculate excess deferrals
2. Return to HCEs with earnings
3. Pay taxes on returned amounts
4. Process within 2.5 months

Example correction:
HCE average: 8% (limit should be 6%)
Excess: 2% of compensation
Must return $4,000 to owner
Plus earnings during year
```

#### Corrective Matching
```
Alternative to refunds:
Increase match to NHCEs
"Buy" the test passage
Often more expensive than refunds

Calculation:
Increase NHCE matching enough
To bring averages into compliance
May cost 3-5% of NHCE payroll
```

### Coverage Test Failures
```
Solutions for poor participation:
1. Auto-enrollment (increases participation)
2. Enhanced matching (incentivizes deferrals)
3. Financial education (awareness building)
4. Safe harbor design (eliminates testing)
5. Plan redesign (different structure)
```

### Top-Heavy Test Issues
```
When key employees have >60% of benefits:
- All NHCEs must get 3% minimum
- Or top-heavy safe harbor match
- Additional administrative burden

Prevention strategies:
- Broad-based allocation formulas
- Employee engagement programs
- Regular testing projections
```

## Testing Strategy for Business Owners

### Demographic Analysis
```
Before plan implementation:
- Count HCEs vs NHCEs
- Project participation rates
- Estimate average deferral rates
- Model testing scenarios

Sweet spot demographics:
- More NHCEs than HCEs
- Young, engaged NHCE population
- Competitive compensation structure
- Low turnover rates
```

### Safe Harbor Election
```
Cost-benefit analysis:
Safe harbor cost: 3% of total payroll
Testing risk elimination: Valuable
Administrative simplicity: Significant

Example:
Total payroll: $600,000
Safe harbor cost: $18,000
Owner can defer: $31,000
Net benefit: $13,000 guaranteed
```

### Plan Design Features
```
Testing-friendly design:
- Broad eligibility (more participants)
- Generous matching (increases deferrals)
- Auto-enrollment (participation boost)
- Financial education (engagement)
- Roth options (additional appeal)

Avoid:
- Restrictive eligibility
- Poor matching formula
- Complicated features
- Limited communication
```

## Controlled Group Rules

### Aggregation Requirements
```
Related entities must be combined:
- Parent-subsidiary (80% ownership)
- Brother-sister (80% ownership)
- Combined group (50% common ownership)

Impact on testing:
All employees considered together
Cannot segregate by entity
Single plan testing required
Complexity increases significantly
```

### Common Ownership Scenarios
```
Scenario 1: Multiple LLCs
Owner has 3 separate LLCs
Same ownership percentage
Must aggregate all employees

Scenario 2: Family Business
Father owns 60%, Son owns 30%
Combined ownership: 90%
Controlled group exists
All employees count for testing

Scenario 3: Spouse Involvement
Husband owns 60%, Wife owns 25%
Attribution rules apply
Controlled group likely
Professional analysis required
```

## Outsourced vs. In-House Testing

### Professional Testing Services
```
Third-party administrator benefits:
- Specialized expertise
- Software and systems
- Regulatory updates
- Error reduction
- Professional liability

Annual cost: $2,000-$8,000
Complexity dependent
Worth the investment for accuracy
```

### In-House Challenges
```
Internal administration risks:
- Software requirements
- Regulatory changes
- Calculation errors
- Time investment
- Liability exposure

Suitable only for:
- Simple plan designs
- Small participant counts
- Safe harbor elections
- Professional oversight
```

## Corrective Action Procedures

### Timing Requirements
```
Correction deadlines:
ADP/ACP tests: 2.5 months after year-end
Extended deadline: 12 months (with 10% penalty)
Form 5558 extension: Additional time available

Late corrections:
- IRS penalties apply
- Plan disqualification risk
- Professional assistance essential
```

### Distribution Methods
```
Excess contribution removal:
1. Calculate excess amounts
2. Determine earnings
3. Process distributions
4. Issue corrective 1099s
5. File amended Forms 5500

QNEC alternative:
- Qualified Non-elective Contribution
- Give money to NHCEs instead
- Often more expensive
- Preserves HCE deferrals
```

## Monitoring and Prevention

### Quarterly Check-ins
```
Mid-year testing projections:
- Update participation rates
- Calculate running averages
- Project year-end results
- Adjust strategies if needed

Early warning system:
Identify potential failures
Implement corrective actions
Educate employees
Adjust contribution strategies
```

### Annual Testing Calendar
```
December: Final projections
January: Gather year-end data
February: Perform calculations
March: File corrections if needed
April: Document lessons learned
May: Plan next year strategies
```

### Employee Engagement Programs
```
Increase NHCE participation:
- Financial wellness seminars
- One-on-one counseling
- Online education tools
- Automatic escalation
- Incentive programs

Goal: Higher NHCE deferrals
Result: Better testing outcomes
Benefit: Higher owner contributions
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Testing is mandatory** - Cannot be ignored or avoided
2. **Safe harbor eliminates most tests** - Worth the cost for simplicity
3. **Demographics drive results** - More NHCEs help testing
4. **Professional help essential** - Too complex for DIY
5. **Prevention better than correction** - Monitor throughout year
6. **Employee engagement critical** - Higher participation helps
7. **Family attribution complicates** - Consider carefully

Remember: Nondiscrimination testing exists to ensure retirement plans benefit all employees, not just owners and executives. While the rules are complex, they can be navigated successfully with proper planning, professional guidance, and proactive employee engagement. The key is building a plan design that naturally passes testing rather than trying to game the system.
