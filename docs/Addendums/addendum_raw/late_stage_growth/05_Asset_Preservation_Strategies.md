# Asset Preservation Strategies Guide

## Overview
As you approach and enter retirement, the focus shifts from accumulation to preservation. Protecting the wealth you've built while ensuring it lasts throughout retirement requires different strategies than those used during your growth years. This guide provides comprehensive approaches to safeguarding your retirement assets.

## The Preservation Mindset Shift

### From Growth to Protection
```
Accumulation phase priorities:
- Maximum returns
- Higher risk tolerance
- Long time horizon
- Dollar-cost averaging
- Tax-deferred growth

Preservation phase priorities:
- Capital protection
- Income generation
- Risk management
- Liquidity needs
- Tax efficiency
```

### Key Preservation Principles
```
1. Sequence of returns risk management
2. Inflation protection
3. Longevity planning
4. Healthcare cost preparation
5. Legacy preservation
6. Tax optimization
7. Liquidity maintenance
```

## Asset Allocation for Preservation

### Age-Based Allocation Guidelines
```
Traditional rules of thumb:
Age in bonds: 60 years = 60% bonds
Modified for longevity: (Age - 10) in bonds

Modern approaches:
Age 55-60: 50-60% stocks, 40-50% bonds
Age 60-65: 40-50% stocks, 50-60% bonds
Age 65-70: 30-40% stocks, 60-70% bonds
Age 70+: 30% stocks, 70% bonds/cash

Adjust for personal factors
```

### The Bucket Strategy
```
Bucket 1: Cash (Years 1-2)
- 1-2 years of expenses
- Money market/savings
- Immediate liquidity
- No market risk

Bucket 2: Bonds (Years 3-10)
- 5-8 years of expenses
- Bond ladder/funds
- Moderate growth
- Reduced volatility

Bucket 3: Stocks (Years 11+)
- Long-term growth
- Dividend focus
- Quality companies
- Inflation protection
```

### Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Design
```
Core holdings (60-70%):
- Large-cap dividend stocks
- Investment-grade bonds
- Stable value funds
- Treasury securities

Satellite holdings (20-30%):
- International bonds
- Real estate (REITs)
- Commodities
- Inflation-protected securities

Alternatives (0-10%):
- Precious metals
- Alternative strategies
- Private investments
- Hedge positions
```

## Income Generation Strategies

### Building Reliable Income Streams
```
Income portfolio components:
Dividend stocks: 2-4% yield
Corporate bonds: 3-5% yield
Municipal bonds: 2-4% tax-free
REITs: 4-6% yield
Preferred stocks: 4-6% yield
CDs/Treasury: 3-5% guaranteed

Target: 3-4% portfolio yield
Covers basic expenses
Growth keeps pace with inflation
```

### Bond Ladder Construction
```
5-Year ladder example:
Year 1: $50,000 in 1-year bonds
Year 2: $50,000 in 2-year bonds
Year 3: $50,000 in 3-year bonds
Year 4: $50,000 in 4-year bonds
Year 5: $50,000 in 5-year bonds

Annual income + principal return
Reinvest at 5-year mark
Interest rate risk managed
```

### Dividend Growth Strategy
```
Quality criteria:
- 10+ years dividend growth
- Payout ratio under 60%
- Strong balance sheet
- Recession-tested
- Diversified sectors

Examples:
Consumer staples
Utilities
Healthcare

Financial services
```

## Risk Management Techniques

### Sequence of Returns Protection
```
The critical first 5 years:
Poor returns early = portfolio depletion
Good returns early = portfolio survival

Protection strategies:
1. Cash cushion (2 years expenses)
2. Flexible withdrawal rates
3. Part-time work option
4. Spending adjustment plans
5. Dynamic asset allocation
```

### Downside Protection Options
```
Portfolio insurance strategies:

Cost-benefit analysis required
Protection vs. growth tradeoff
Professional guidance recommended
```

### Inflation Hedging
```
Inflation protection assets:
- TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected)
- I Bonds (up to $10,000/year)
- Real estate/REITs
- Commodities basket
- Dividend growth stocks
- International exposure

Target: 20-30% inflation-sensitive
```

## Tax-Efficient Preservation
