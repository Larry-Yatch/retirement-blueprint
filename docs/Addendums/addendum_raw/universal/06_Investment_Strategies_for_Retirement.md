# Investment Strategies for Retirement Guide

## Overview
Successful retirement investing requires a fundamental shift from accumulation to preservation and income generation. This guide provides comprehensive strategies for managing investments before, during, and throughout retirement to ensure financial security.

## Pre-Retirement Investment Planning

### Glide Path Strategy
```
10+ years to retirement:
- Growth focus
- 70-80% stocks
- Risk tolerance higher
- Time to recover

5-10 years:
- Balanced approach
- 50-60% stocks
- Risk reduction
- Volatility management

0-5 years:
- Capital preservation
- 40-50% stocks
- Sequence risk critical
- Income preparation
```

### Sequence of Returns Risk
```
The danger zone:
5 years before to 5 years after

Why it matters:
Poor returns early + withdrawals = 
Permanent portfolio damage

Protection strategies:
- Reduce equity exposure
- Build cash reserves
- Delay retirement if needed
- Flexible spending plans
```

## Asset Allocation Strategies

### Age-Based Rules of Thumb
```
Traditional: 100 - Age = Stock %
Modern: 110 - Age = Stock %
Aggressive: 120 - Age = Stock %

Example at 65:
Traditional: 35% stocks
Modern: 45% stocks
Aggressive: 55% stocks

Adjust for:
- Risk tolerance
- Other income
- Health/longevity
- Legacy goals
```

### Three-Bucket Approach
```
Bucket 1 (0-3 years):
- Cash and equivalents
- Short-term bonds
- Stable value
- 100% liquid

Bucket 2 (4-10 years):
- Balanced allocation
- Moderate growth
- Some volatility OK
- Refills Bucket 1

Bucket 3 (11+ years):
- Growth focused
- Higher volatility
- Long-term inflation hedge
- Legacy assets
```

## Income Generation Strategies

### Systematic Withdrawal Plans
```
4% Rule basics:
- Withdraw 4% first year

```

```
Income portfolio construction:

Caution:
Don't chase yield
Diversification still key
Total return matters
Tax efficiency important
```

### Bond Laddering
```
How it works:

Each year, one matures
Reinvest at 10-year mark
Predictable income stream
