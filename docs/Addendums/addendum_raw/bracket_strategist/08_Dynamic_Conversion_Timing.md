# Dynamic Conversion Timing Guide

## Overview
Timing Roth conversions strategically can save tens of thousands in taxes while building tax-free wealth. This guide provides frameworks for dynamically timing conversions based on income fluctuations, market conditions, life events, and tax law changes.

## Core Timing Principles

### The Three Timing Dimensions

1. **Income Timing**
   - Low-income years
   - Retirement transitions
   - Business cycles
   - Life events

2. **Market Timing**
   - Bear market opportunities
   - Sector rotations
   - Volatility windows
   - Recovery potential

3. **Tax Law Timing**
   - Current rate environment
   - Sunset provisions
   - Political changes
   - State considerations

## Income-Based Timing Strategies

### Identifying Conversion Windows

**Prime Opportunities:**
```
1. Job transitions
   - Between jobs: 3-6 months low income
   - Convert aggressively
   - Fill up low brackets

2. Early retirement
   - Age 60-65: No wages, no SS
   - Annual conversions
   - 5-10 year window

3. Sabbaticals
   - Planned time off
   - Convert during break
   - Significant savings

4. Business downturns
   - Low profit years
   - Net operating losses
   - Offset conversion income
```

### Income Volatility Mapping

**Creating Your Timeline:**
```
Year 1: $200,000 (working)
Year 2: $180,000 (working)
Year 3: $50,000 (sabbatical) ← Convert here
Year 4: $150,000 (new job)
Year 5: $40,000 (early retirement) ← Convert here
Year 6-10: $30,000 (retired) ← Major conversion window
```

### Bracket-Filling Strategy

**Annual Process:**
```
Step 1: Calculate base income
Pensions: $20,000
Part-time: $15,000
Interest: $5,000
Total: $40,000

Step 2: Determine taxable income
AGI: $40,000
Standard deduction: -$29,200 (married)
Taxable: $10,800

Step 3: Calculate conversion capacity
Top of 12% bracket: $94,300
Current taxable: -$10,800
Can convert: $83,500 at 12%

Top of 22% bracket: $201,050
Current taxable: -$10,800
Can convert: $190,250 total
```

## Market-Based Timing

### Bear Market Conversions

**Why Market Drops Create Opportunities:**
```
Example: $100,000 IRA
Market drops 30%
Value now: $70,000

Convert at $70,000:
- Pay tax on $70,000
- Same shares converted
- Recovery happens in Roth
- 30% more tax-free growth
```

### Sector Rotation Strategy

**Targeted Conversions:**
```
IRA holdings:
- Tech stocks: Down 40%
- Healthcare: Up 10%
- Energy: Down 25%
- Bonds: Flat

Strategy:
Convert tech and energy positions
Leave healthcare and bonds
Maximum shares at minimum tax
```

### Volatility Windows

**Intra-Year Timing:**
```
January: Market high, IRA = $200,000
March: Correction, IRA = $160,000
April: Convert $50,000 (lower value)
December: Recovery, Roth = $65,000
Effective "discount": 20%
```

## Life Event Triggers

### Major Life Transitions

**Retirement Transition:**
```
Final year strategy:
Jan-June: Full salary ($100,000)
July-Dec: Retired ($0)

Actions:
- Max 401(k) while working
- Convert IRA in Q4
- Half-year income only
- Optimal tax situation
```

**Divorce Considerations:**
```
Status change opportunities:
- Filing status changes
- Income typically drops
- Asset division
- Convert during transition year
```

**Health Events:**
```
Large medical deductions:
- Offset conversion income
- Rare opportunity
- Time carefully
- Document everything
```

### Business Life Cycle

**Startup Phase:**
```
Years 1-2: Losses likely
- Convert traditional IRA
- Losses offset taxes
- Build Roth early
```

**Growth Phase:**
```
Years 3-5: Increasing income
- Moderate conversions
- Watch brackets
- Balance approach
```

**Sale Year:**
```
Business sale planning:
- Year before: Last conversions
- Sale year: High income
- Year after: Possible window
```

## Tax Law Timing

### Current Environment Analysis

**2025 Considerations:**
```
Current state:
- Historically low rates
- 2017 tax cuts sunset 2026
- Rates scheduled to increase

Strategy:
- Accelerate conversions
- Lock in current rates
- Front-load strategy
```

### Political Cycle Planning

**Election Years:**
- Uncertainty increases
- May pause major conversions
- Wait for clarity
- Quick action after

**Policy Change Windows:**
- New tax laws often have delays
- Transition periods
- Planning opportunities
- Stay informed

## Multi-Year Conversion Planning

### 5-Year Conversion Model

**Systematic Approach:**
```
Starting IRA: $500,000
Target: Convert all in 5 years

Year 1: Convert $80,000 (low income year)
Year 2: Convert $100,000 (market down 20%)
Year 3: Convert $90,000 (normal year)
Year 4: Convert $110,000 (low income)
Year 5: Convert $120,000 (final push)

Total converted: $500,000
Taxes optimized via timing
```

### Dynamic Annual Adjustments

**Quarterly Review Process:**
```
Q1: Set base conversion target
Q2: Adjust for YTD income
Q3: Consider market conditions
Q4: Execute based on actuals
```

## Advanced Timing Techniques

### Tax Attribute Coordination

**Net Operating Loss (NOL) Usage:**
```
Business NOL: $100,000
Carryforward available

Strategy:
- Convert $100,000 IRA
- NOL offsets income
- Effectively tax-free conversion
- Rare opportunity
```

### Charitable Timing

**Bunching with Conversions:**
```
Year 1: 
- Convert $50,000
- Standard deduction

Year 2:
- Convert $100,000
- Bunch charitable: $50,000
- Itemize deductions
- Offset higher conversion
```

### State Residency Timing

**Multi-State Strategy:**
```
Current: New York resident
Planned: Florida move in 2 years

Conversion timing:
- Minimal conversions now
- Establish FL residency
- Aggressive conversions after
- Save 10.9% state tax
```
