## Multi-State Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Geographic Arbitrage
**Working Years vs. Retirement**

```
Current: California resident
- Income: $200,000
- Federal tax: 24%
- CA state tax: 9.3%
- Combined: 33.3%

Future: Nevada resident
- Retirement income: $100,000
- Federal tax: 22%
- NV state tax: 0%
- Combined: 22%

Strategy: Defer income to retirement
Traditional 401(k) savings: 11.3% state tax
```

### Strategy 2: Strategic Residency Timing

**Roth Conversion Planning:**
```
Scenario: Planning CA to FL move

Option A: Convert before move
- $100,000 conversion
- CA tax (9.3%): $9,300
- Total tax: $33,300

Option B: Convert after establishing FL residency
- $100,000 conversion
- FL tax: $0
- Total tax: $24,000
- Savings: $9,300
```

### Strategy 3: Split Residency Optimization

**183-Day Rule Management:**
```
Primary residence: Florida
Vacation home: New York
Strategy: Spend <183 days in NY

Tax result:
- FL resident for tax purposes
- 0% state tax on retirement income
- Maintain NY property
- Best of both worlds
```

## State-Specific Contribution Strategies

### High-Tax State Residents

**Maximize Pre-Tax Contributions:**
```
California resident example:
$10,000 to traditional 401(k) saves:
- Federal (24%): $2,400
- State (9.3%): $930
- Total savings: $3,330 (33.3%)

Enhanced benefit vs. low-tax state
```

**State Tax Deduction Opportunities:**
Some states offer deductions for:
- 529 plan contributions
- State-sponsored retirement plans
- Health savings accounts
- Charitable contributions

### Low/No-Tax State Residents

**Consider Roth Emphasis:**
```
Texas resident example:
Current marginal rate: 24% (federal only)
Future state uncertain

Strategy:
- More Roth contributions
- No state tax benefit to defer
- Hedge against future moves
- Greater flexibility
```

$100,000 income difference: $9,000/year
10 years retirement: $90,000 saved
```
