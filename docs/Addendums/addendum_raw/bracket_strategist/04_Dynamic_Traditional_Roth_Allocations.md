# Dynamic Traditional/Roth Allocation Guide

## Overview
As a Bracket Strategist, your contribution decisions should adapt to changing income, tax laws, and life circumstances. This guide provides a framework for dynamically allocating between traditional and Roth accounts to minimize lifetime taxes.

## The Dynamic Allocation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **No Set-It-and-Forget-It**
   - Annual income varies
   - Tax laws change
   - Life circumstances evolve
   - Strategy must adapt

2. **Marginal Rate Focus**
   - Current bracket drives decisions
   - Future projections matter
   - State taxes included
   - Effective rate secondary

3. **Flexibility Over Dogma**
   - No absolute rules
   - Guidelines not mandates
   - Personal factors weigh
   - Adjust as needed

## Annual Decision Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Current Marginal Rate
```
Gross Income:                    $_______
Above-the-line deductions:      -$_______
Adjusted Gross Income:          =$_______
Standard/Itemized deduction:    -$_______
Taxable Income:                 =$_______

Find your bracket:
- 10%: $0-$11,600 (single)
- 12%: $11,600-$47,150
- 22%: $47,150-$100,525
- 24%: $100,525-$191,950
- 32%: $191,950-$243,725
- 35%: $243,725-$609,350
- 37%: $609,350+

Add state tax rate:             +____%
Total marginal rate:            _____%
```

### Step 2: Project Future Rate
```
Retirement Income Sources:
- Social Security:              $_______
- Pension:                      $_______
- Required Minimum Distributions:$_______
- Other income:                 $_______
Total projected income:         $_______

Projected tax bracket:          ____%
Plus state rate:               +____%
Future marginal rate:           _____%
```

### Step 3: Apply Decision Matrix

**Decision Matrix:**
| Current Rate | Future Rate | Primary Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 37% | Any | 100% Traditional |
| 35% | Any | 90% Traditional, 10% Roth |
| 32% | Higher | 100% Traditional |
| 32% | Same/Lower | 75% Traditional, 25% Roth |
| 24% | Higher | 75% Traditional, 25% Roth |
| 24% | Same/Lower | 50% Traditional, 50% Roth |
| 22% | Higher | 50% Traditional, 50% Roth |
| 22% | Same/Lower | 25% Traditional, 75% Roth |
| 12% | Any | 100% Roth |
| 10% | Any | 100% Roth |

## Income Volatility Strategies

### Variable Income Planning

**High-Income Year Strategy:**
```
Example: Bonus year or business windfall
Normal income: $120,000 (24% bracket)
This year: $200,000 (32% bracket)

Action:
- Switch to 100% traditional
- Maximize pre-tax contributions
- Defer income if possible
- No Roth conversions
```

**Low-Income Year Strategy:**
```
Example: Sabbatical or job transition
Normal income: $120,000 (24% bracket)
This year: $50,000 (12% bracket)

Action:
- Switch to 100% Roth
- Consider Roth conversions
- Fill up 12% bracket
- Lock in low rate
```

### Business Owner Considerations

**Profit Fluctuations:**
```
Year 1: $200,000 profit → Traditional focus
Year 2: $75,000 profit → Roth focus
Year 3: $150,000 profit → Balanced approach

Key: Adjust quarterly based on YTD income
```

## Life Stage Allocation Models

### Early Career (25-35)
**Default Position:** 50/50 Traditional/Roth
```
Reasoning:
- Income likely to grow
- Long time horizon
- Tax rates uncertain
- Hedge both ways

Adjustments:
- Higher income: More traditional
- Lower income: More Roth
- Grad school years: 100% Roth
```

### Peak Earning Years (35-50)
**Default Position:** 75/25 Traditional/Roth
```
Reasoning:
- Highest tax brackets
- Current deduction valuable
- Still want some Roth
- Building all buckets

Adjustments:
- Job loss: Switch to Roth
- Promotion: More traditional
- Side business: Depends on profit
```

### Pre-Retirement (50-65)
**Default Position:** 60/40 Traditional/Roth
```
Reasoning:
- Still high income
- Catch-up contributions
- Conversion planning
- Flexibility needed

Adjustments:
- Early retirement: More Roth
- Peak earnings: More traditional
- Phased retirement: Dynamic
```

### Retirement (65+)
**Default Position:** Conversions only
```
Focus shifts to:
- Roth conversions
- Bracket management
- RMD planning
- Legacy optimization
```

## Special Situations

### Two-Income Households
```
Spouse 1: $150,000 (24% bracket contribution)
Spouse 2: $50,000 (12% bracket contribution)

Strategy:
- Spouse 1: Traditional 401(k)
- Spouse 2: Roth 401(k)
- Optimize individually
- Coordinate overall
```

### Stock Option/RSU Years
```
Normal income: $100,000
RSU vesting: +$100,000
Total: $200,000 (32% bracket)

Action:
- Traditional 401(k) maximum
- Offset RSU income
- No Roth contributions
- Plan for next year
```

### Deduction Bunching Years
```
Itemizing with large deductions:
- Mortgage interest
- Charitable giving
- State taxes
- Medical expenses

Lower effective rate = More Roth
Higher marginal rate = Still matters
Balance both factors
```

## Quarterly Adjustment Process

### Q1 Review (April)
- Calculate Q1 income
- Project annual total
- Adjust if needed
- Document reasoning

### Q2 Review (July)
- Mid-year checkpoint
- Update projections
- Major adjustments

### Q3 Review (October)
- 75% through year
- Fine-tune strategy
- Year-end planning
- Final adjustments

### Q4 Review (December)
- Final calculations
- Last-minute changes
- Next year planning
- Document results

## Implementation Tactics

### 401(k) Adjustments
**Online Changes:**
```
Most plans allow:
- Immediate changes
- Future date effective
- Multiple changes/year
- Percentage or dollar

Process:
1. Log into account
2. Change contribution election
3. Select traditional vs. Roth %
4. Save confirmation
```

### IRA Contributions
**Flexible Timing:**
```
Contribution deadline: April 15
Designation flexibility: Until filing

Strategy:
- Wait until year-end
- Know actual income
- Optimize allocation
- Recharacterize if needed
```

### Mid-Year Corrections
**If Income Surprises:**
```
Expected: $100,000 (50/50 split)
Actual trending: $150,000

July adjustment:
- Change to 75/25 traditional
- Calculate YTD contributions
- Adjust for remainder
- Still optimize full year
```

## Documentation System

### Track Your Decisions
```
ANNUAL ALLOCATION RECORD

Year: 2025
Projected income: $120,000
Actual income: $125,000
Marginal rate: 24%

Contributions:
- Traditional 401(k): $15,000
- Roth 401(k): $8,500
- Traditional IRA: $0
- Roth IRA: $7,000
- Split: 68/32 Traditional/Roth

Reasoning: Higher income than expected
Next year plan: Monitor bonus potential
```

### Quarterly Tracking
| Quarter | Income | Rate | Trad % | Roth % | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Q1 | $30k | 22% | 50% | 50% | On track |
| Q2 | $35k | 24% | 75% | 25% | Bonus |
| Q3 | $28k | 22% | 50% | 50% | Normal |
| Q4 | $32k | 24% | 75% | 25% | Adjust |

## Common Dynamic Allocation Mistakes

### Strategy Errors
❌ Set and forget approach
❌ Ignoring income changes
❌ No quarterly reviews
❌ Emotional decisions
❌ Following others blindly

### Implementation Errors
❌ Missing adjustment windows
❌ Poor documentation
❌ Forgetting state taxes

## Advanced Techniques

### Tax Loss Harvesting Coordination
```
Large capital losses: $50,000
Offset gains: $20,000
Carry forward: $30,000
Ordinary income offset: $3,000/year

Impact: Lower AGI for 10 years
Action: Slightly more Roth during this period
```

### Multi-State Considerations
```
Work in NYC: High tax
Plan to retire to Florida: No tax

Current: Emphasize traditional
Future: Conversions after move
Dynamic: Based on timeline
```

## Annual Strategy Review

### Year-End Analysis
1. Compare projected vs. actual
2. Calculate effective allocation
3. Assess decision quality
4. Document lessons learned
5. Plan next year

### Questions to Ask
- Did income match projections?
- Were adjustments timely?
- What surprised you?
- What worked well?
- What needs improvement?

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Allocation Efficiency Score
```
Perfect allocation = 100 points

Deductions:
- Each bracket mistake: -10 points
