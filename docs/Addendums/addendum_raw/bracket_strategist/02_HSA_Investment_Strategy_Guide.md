# HSA Investment Strategy Guide

## Overview
The Health Savings Account (HSA) offers unmatched triple tax advantages, making it a cornerstone of the Bracket Strategist's toolkit. This guide shows how to maximize your HSA as a powerful retirement investment vehicle rather than just a medical expense account.

## Understanding the Triple Tax Advantage

### The Three Tax Benefits
1. **Tax-Deductible Contributions**
   - Reduces current taxable income
   - Above-the-line deduction
   - Not subject to itemization limits
   - Payroll contributions avoid FICA too

2. **Tax-Free Growth**
   - All investment gains untaxed
   - Compounds more powerfully
   - No annual tax drag
   - Better than traditional IRA

3. **Tax-Free Qualified Withdrawals**
   - Medical expenses anytime
   - After 65: Any purpose (taxed like IRA)
   - No RMDs ever
   - Most flexible retirement account

### HSA vs. Other Accounts

## HSA Investment Strategy Framework

### Strategy 1: Maximum Growth Approach
**Core Principle:** Never use HSA for current medical expenses

**Implementation:**
```
1. Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket
2. Save all medical receipts forever
3. Invest HSA aggressively for growth
4. Let compound for decades
5. Reimburse yourself tax-free anytime
```

**Example Power:**
```
Annual contribution: $4,300
30 years at 8% return: $524,000
All tax-free for medical expenses
Or taxable like IRA after 65
```

### Strategy 2: Investment Threshold Management

**Typical HSA Structure:**
```
First $1,000-2,000: Cash (required)
Above threshold: Investment options

Strategy:
- Maintain minimum in cash
- Invest everything else
- Review threshold quarterly
- Maximize invested percentage
```

**Optimization Tips:**
- Some providers have no threshold
- Others allow $0 cash balance
- Shop around if threshold high
- Consider switching providers

### Strategy 3: Asset Allocation

**Aggressive Allocation (20+ years):**
```
100% Stocks:
- US Large Cap: 50%
- US Small Cap: 20%
- International: 30%
- No bonds needed
- Maximum growth focus
```

**Moderate Allocation (10-20 years):**
```
80/20 Stocks/Bonds:
- US Stocks: 60%
- International: 20%
- Bonds: 20%
- Still growth-focused
- Some stability
```

**Conservative (Near Retirement):**
```
60/40 Stocks/Bonds:
- Balanced approach
- Preserve capital
- Still some growth
- Ready for use
```
