# Traditional vs. Roth Account Setup Guide

## Overview
As a Bracket Strategist, your retirement account choices should align with current and future tax optimization. This guide helps you set up and coordinate traditional and Roth accounts to maximize tax efficiency throughout your lifetime.

## Understanding Your Tax-Focused Approach

### The Bracket Strategist Philosophy
- Minimize lifetime tax burden
- Strategic account diversification
- Dynamic contribution allocation
- Tax bracket optimization
- Future flexibility maximization

### Key Decision Framework
```
Current Tax Bracket → Account Type Decision
Higher brackets (24%+) → Emphasize Traditional
Middle brackets (22%) → Balanced approach
Lower brackets (10-12%) → Emphasize Roth
Future expectations → Adjust strategy
```

## Account Setup Priority Order

### 1. Employer 401(k) - Traditional
**Setup Steps:**
1. Enroll immediately upon eligibility
2. Contribute to full match first
3. Select pre-tax (traditional) deferrals
4. Set automatic annual increases
5. Choose low-cost index funds

**Why Traditional First:**
- Immediate tax deduction
- Reduces current bracket
- Employer match is free money
- Can convert later if beneficial

### 2. HSA (Triple Tax Advantage)
**Setup Requirements:**
- High-deductible health plan (HDHP)
- Not enrolled in Medicare
- No other health coverage
- Not a dependent

**Configuration:**
```
2025 Limits:
Individual: $4,300
Family: $9,300
55+ Catch-up: +$1,000

Investment threshold: Usually $1,000
Invest above threshold aggressively
Never use for current medical expenses
```

### 3. Roth IRA (Direct or Backdoor)
**Direct Contribution Setup:**
- Open at major brokerage
- Set up automatic contributions
- $7,000 annual limit (2025)
- $8,000 if 50+

**Backdoor Setup (if over income limits):**
1. Open traditional IRA
2. Make non-deductible contribution
3. Convert immediately to Roth
4. File Form 8606
5. Repeat annually

### 4. Additional Employer 401(k)
**After Match Optimization:**
```
If 24% bracket or higher:
- Continue traditional 401(k)
- Max out at $23,500

If 22% bracket:
- Split traditional/Roth 401(k)
- Based on future projections

If 12% bracket or lower:
- Switch to Roth 401(k)
- Lock in low tax rate
```

## Account Setup Best Practices

### Traditional 401(k) Setup
**Investment Elections:**
- Target-date fund for simplicity
- Or build three-fund portfolio:
  - US stocks: 60%
  - International stocks: 30%
  - Bonds: 10% (adjust for age)

**Beneficiary Designations:**
- Primary: Spouse (usually)
- Contingent: Children/Trust
- Review annually
- Update after life changes

### Roth IRA Setup
**Provider Selection:**
- Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab
- No account fees
- Low-cost funds
- Good online tools
- Easy conversion process

**Investment Strategy:**
- More aggressive than traditional
- Longer time horizon
- Tax-free growth maximizes returns
- Consider growth stocks/funds

### HSA Setup
**Provider Considerations:**
- Low fees important
- Investment options at threshold
- Don't pick based on debit card
- Consider employer's choice first

**Triple Tax Strategy:**
- Deduct contributions
- Tax-free growth
- Tax-free medical withdrawals
- Or taxable at 65+ (like IRA)

## Coordination Strategies

### Annual Contribution Workflow
```
January:
- Set new year contributions
- Adjust for limit changes
- Review prior year

February-November:
- Monitor payroll deferrals
- Track IRA contributions
- Invest HSA as funded

December:

- Make catch-up contributions
- Plan next year changes
```

### Tax Bracket Management
**Real-Time Monitoring:**
- Track year-to-date income
- Project year-end bracket
- Adjust contributions accordingly
- Consider Roth conversions

**Dynamic Adjustments:**
```
If income higher than expected:
- Increase traditional 401(k)
- Reduce taxable income
- Defer bonuses if possible

If income lower than expected:
- Switch to Roth contributions
- Consider Roth conversions
- Lock in low tax rate
```
