## Understanding 401(k) Basics

A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that offers:
- Tax-advantaged savings

- Creditor protection
- Portability when changing jobs

### Types of 401(k) Contributions

Traditional 401(k):
- Pre-tax contributions
- Reduces current taxable income
- Taxed on withdrawal in retirement
- Best when current tax rate > future

Roth 401(k):
- After-tax contributions
- No current tax deduction
- Tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- Best when current tax rate < future
```

## First Steps: Enrollment

### Immediate Action Items
1. **Enroll ASAP** - Don't leave free money on the table
2. **Contribute to match** - At minimum
3. **Choose investments** - Don't stay in cash
4. **Name beneficiaries** - Critical step
5. **Set up online access** - Monitor regularly

### Understanding Your Plan Document
**Key Items to Review:**

- Vesting schedule
- Match formula
- Investment options
- Loan provisions

## Maximizing Employer Match

### Common Match Formulas
```
50% up to 6% of salary:
Your contribution: 6% = $300/month (on $60k salary)
Employer match: 3% = $150/month
Total: 9% = $450/month

100% up to 3% of salary:
Your contribution: 3% = $150/month
Employer match: 3% = $150/month
Total: 6% = $300/month

Dollar-for-dollar up to $3,000:
Your contribution: $250/month
Employer match: $250/month (up to annual max)
Total: $500/month
```

### Match Optimization Strategy
**Priority Order:**
1. Contribute to full match (free money!)
2. Pay off high-interest debt
3. Build emergency fund
4. Increase 401(k) beyond match
5. Max out contribution limits

### Vesting Schedules
```
Immediate vesting:
- Your money: Always 100% vested
- Match: Yours immediately

Graded vesting (common):
Year 1: 0%
Year 2: 20%
Year 3: 40%
Year 4: 60%
Year 5: 80%
Year 6: 100%

Cliff vesting:
Years 1-2: 0%
Year 3+: 100%
```

## Contribution Strategies

### Starting Points by Age
```
20s: Start with match, increase 1% annually
- Year 1: 6% (to get 3% match)
- Year 2: 7%
- Year 3: 8%
- Goal: 15% by 30

30s: Target 15% total savings
- 401(k): 10%
- Match: 3%
- IRA: 2%
- Total: 15%

40s: Accelerate if behind
- Consider 15-20%

- Catch-up at 50

50s+: Maximize with catch-up

```

### Traditional vs. Roth Decision Framework
