# Roth Conversion Strategies Guide

## Overview
The years between retirement and Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) represent a golden window for Roth conversions. Converting Traditional IRA assets to Roth during low-income years can save hundreds of thousands in lifetime taxes while creating a tax-free legacy.

## Understanding Roth Conversions

### What is a Roth Conversion?
```
The process:
Traditional IRA → Roth IRA
Pay taxes now on converted amount
Future growth tax-free forever
No RMDs during owner's lifetime

Key benefits:
✓ Tax-free withdrawals
✓ No RMDs at 73
✓ Tax-free to heirs
✓ Hedge against tax increases
✓ Medicare premium management
```

### When Conversions Make Sense
```
Optimal scenarios:
- Current tax rate < future tax rate
- Low income years (retirement)
- Before Social Security starts
- Before RMDs begin
- Market downturns
- Estate planning goals
- State tax arbitrage
```

## The Conversion Sweet Spot

### Ages 60-72: Golden Years
```
Why this period is ideal:
- Often retired (lower income)
- Before Social Security (age 62-70)
- Before RMDs (age 73)
- Healthcare subsidies possible
- Time for tax-free growth
- Estate planning window

Example timeline:
Age 60-65: Aggressive conversions
Age 66-70: Moderate conversions
Age 71-72: Final conversions
Age 73+: RMDs begin
```

### Tax Bracket Management
```
2025 Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly):
10%: $0 - $23,850
12%: $23,850 - $96,950
22%: $96,950 - $206,700
24%: $206,700 - $394,600
32%: $394,600 - $501,000

Strategy: Fill lower brackets
Convert to top of desired bracket
Leave room for other income
```

## Conversion Strategies

### Fill the Bracket Strategy
```
Annual approach:
1. Calculate current taxable income
2. Determine target bracket top
3. Convert difference
4. Maximize low-rate space

Example:
Other income: $50,000
12% bracket top: $96,950
Conversion capacity: $46,950
Stay in 12% bracket entirely
```

### Systematic Multi-Year Plan
```
5-Year conversion example:
Starting Traditional IRA: $500,000
Target: Convert all before RMDs

Year 1: Convert $100,000 (market down)
Year 2: Convert $100,000 (still working)
Year 3: Convert $100,000 (retired)
Year 4: Convert $100,000 (low income)
Year 5: Convert $100,000 (before SS)

Result: $500,000 + growth now tax-free
```

### Opportunistic Conversions
```
Market downturn strategy:
Traditional IRA drops 20%
Convert same shares at lower value
Pay tax on reduced amount
Shares recover in Roth tax-free

Example:
Pre-crash value: $100,000
Post-crash value: $80,000
Tax on conversion: 22% × $80,000 = $17,600
Recovery to $100,000: Tax-free
Savings: $4,400 in taxes
```

## Tax Planning Considerations

### Federal Tax Impact
```
Conversion income treatment:
- Ordinary income in year converted
- No 10% early withdrawal penalty
- Increases AGI/taxable income
- May trigger higher brackets
- Affects other tax benefits

Withholding options:
- Pay from outside funds (best)
- Withhold from conversion (reduces Roth)
- Quarterly estimates
- Year-end payment
```

### State Tax Strategies
```
Geographic arbitrage:
Work years: High-tax state (CA 13.3%)
Retirement: Low-tax state (NV 0%)

Strategy:
- Don't convert while in CA
- Move to NV first
- Then convert at 0% state tax
- Save 13.3% on conversions

Common retirement states:
No income tax: FL, TX, NV, WA, WY, SD, AK
Low tax: AZ, NC, SC
```

### Medicare Premium Impact (IRMAA)
```
Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount:
Based on MAGI from 2 years prior

2025 IRMAA brackets (single):
Under $103,000: Standard premium
$103,000-$129,000: +$74.20/month
$129,000-$161,000: +$185.40/month
$161,000-$193,000: +$296.70/month
$193,000-$500,000: +$408.00/month
Over $500,000: +$444.60/month

Planning required:
Conversions at age 63 affect age 65 Medicare
Balance conversion benefits vs. premium costs
```

## Advanced Conversion Strategies

### The Ladder Strategy
```
Building tax-free income:
Convert smaller amounts annually
Each conversion has 5-year clock
After 5 years, can access tax-free

Example ladder:
Age 55: Convert $50,000
Age 56: Convert $50,000
Age 57: Convert $50,000
Age 58: Convert $50,000
Age 59: Convert $50,000

At 60: First $50,000 accessible
At 61: Second $50,000 accessible
Creates income bridge
```

### Mega Backdoor Roth
```
Using after-tax 401(k):
Contribute after-tax to 401(k)
Convert to Roth IRA immediately
No income limits apply
Up to $46,500 additional annually

Combined with regular conversions:
Regular conversion: $100,000
Mega backdoor: $46,500
Total Roth addition: $146,500
Accelerated tax-free accumulation
```

### Charitable Integration
```
QCD offset strategy (age 70.5+):
Convert $50,000 to Roth
Give $50,000 QCD to charity
Net tax effect: Neutral
Result: $50,000 moved to Roth

Benefits:
- Satisfies charitable goals
- Reduces Traditional IRA
- Creates tax-free Roth
- No net tax increase
```
