# Group 401(k) vs Solo 401(k) Decision Guide

## Overview
Business owners with employees face a critical decision: implement a group 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees or maintain solo plans for owners only. This guide helps you evaluate the costs, benefits, and strategic implications of each approach.

## Understanding the Fundamental Difference

### Solo 401(k) (Owner Only)
```
Eligibility:
- Business owner with no W-2 employees
- Spouse can participate
- 1099 contractors don't count
- Sole proprietor or single-member LLC

Benefits:
- Maximum contribution limits
- No employee coverage costs
- Simple administration
- Complete control
- No nondiscrimination testing
```

### Group 401(k) (Covers Employees)
```
Requirements:
- Must cover all eligible employees
- Equal benefits for all participants
- Complex administration
- Nondiscrimination testing
- Higher costs

Benefits:
- Can add defined benefit plans
- Profit sharing opportunities
- Employee retention tool
- Advanced strategies available
```

## When You Must Use Group 401(k)

### Employee Definitions
```
Must include in group plan:
- All W-2 employees
- Family members on payroll
- Part-time over 500 hours (2 years)
- Leased employees
- Union employees (if required)

Can exclude:
- 1099 independent contractors
- Employees under age 21
- Employees under 1 year service
- Non-resident aliens
```

### Common Misclassifications
```
Often wrongly classified as contractors:
❌ Work set hours/schedule
❌ Use company equipment
❌ Supervised directly
❌ Company provides training
❌ Only work for your company

Proper contractors:
✓ Set their own hours
✓ Use own equipment
✓ Work independently
✓ Have other clients
✓ Invoice for services
```

Total annual cost: $200-$800
Participant coverage: 1-2 people
```

### Group 401(k) Costs
```
Annual costs:

- Employee costs (5 × 3%): $7,500
- Admin costs: $5,000
- Total cost: $12,500
- Net benefit: $18,500

Decision: Solo wins if possible
```

## Strategic Considerations

### When Group 401(k) Makes Sense

#### High Owner Compensation
```
If annual income > $500,000:
- Defined benefit plans available
- Profit sharing advantages
- Tax deductions valuable
- Employee costs manageable percentage

Example:
Owner income: $800,000
Employee costs: $25,000 (3%)
DB plan savings: $200,000
ROI: 8:1 ratio
```

#### Older Owner, Younger Employees
```
Age demographics favor owner:
Owner age: 55
Employee avg age: 30

Benefits:
- DB plan heavily favors owner
- Profit sharing age-weighting
- Higher contribution limits
- Better discrimination testing
```

#### Employee Retention Strategy
```
Competitive benefits needed:
- Tight labor market
- Key employee retention
- Industry standard
- Recruitment advantage

Value beyond owner contributions:
- Employee loyalty
- Reduced turnover
- Attraction tool
- Company culture
```

### When Solo 401(k) Preferred

#### Young Owner, Expensive Employees
```
Demographics work against group plan:
Owner age: 35
5 employees, average age: 40

Problems:
- DB plan doesn't favor owner
- High employee costs
- Limited additional benefits
- Solo 401(k) nearly as good
```

#### Tight Profit Margins
```
Low-margin business:
Annual profit: $200,000
Employee plan costs: $15,000 (7.5%)

Impact too high:
- Reduces owner take-home
- Minimal additional benefit
- Administrative burden
- Cash flow impact
```

#### Simple Business Structure
```
Preference for simplicity:
- Owner wants control
- Minimal administration
- No HR complexity
- Focus on business operations
```

## Implementation Strategies

### Transitioning Solo to Group
```
Growth scenario:
Year 1-3: Solo 401(k)
Year 4: Hire first employee
Decision point: Group or terminate?

Options:
1. Implement group plan
2. Reclassify as contractors
3. Use separate entity
4. Spin off employee functions
```

### Multiple Entity Strategy
```
Advanced structure:
Entity A: Owner only (Solo 401(k))
Entity B: Employees (Group 401(k) or no plan)

Requirements:
- Separate businesses
- Different services
- Independent operation
- No controlled group
```

### Safe Harbor Considerations
```
Group plan enhancement:
3% Non-elective contribution

Benefits:
- Eliminates ADP/ACP testing
- Owner can max out
- Predictable costs
- Simplified administration

Cost calculation:
Total payroll × 3% = annual cost
Worth it if owner maxes plan
```

## Compliance and Testing Issues

### Nondiscrimination Testing
```
Required tests for group plans:
- ADP (deferral percentages)
- ACP (matching/after-tax)
- Top-heavy testing
- Coverage testing

Failure consequences:
- Excess deferrals returned
- Lost tax benefits
- IRS penalties
- Plan disqualification risk
```

### Safe Harbor Alternatives
```
Option 1: 3% Non-elective
- Give all employees 3%
- No testing required
- Highest cost

Option 2: 4% Match
- Match up to 4% of pay
- No ADP/ACP testing
- Variable cost

Option 3: QACA
- 3% auto-enrollment
- 2% match + escalation
- Most complex
```

## Advanced Planning Opportunities

### Defined Benefit Plans
```
Only available with group plans:
- $280,000+ annual contributions
- Age-weighted heavily to owner
- Requires actuarial services
- High employee costs

Sweet spot:
- Owner 50+, employees 30s
- High income ($500k+)
- Stable business
- 10+ year horizon
```

### Cash Balance Plans
```
Hybrid DB/DC approach:
- Predictable contributions
- Lower employee costs
- Easier to understand
- More portable for employees

When appropriate:
- Owner 45+
- Moderate age spread
- Want DB benefits
- Employee relations important
```

### Profit Sharing Integration
```
Variable contribution strategy:
- Good years: Higher contributions
- Tough years: Reduce/eliminate
- Age-weighted formulas
- Integration with Social Security

Flexibility advantage:
- Matches business cycles
- Maintains employee coverage
- Owner controls costs
- Performance-based culture
```
