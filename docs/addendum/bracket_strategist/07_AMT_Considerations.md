# AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) Considerations

## Overview
The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) can derail even the best tax optimization strategies. This guide helps Bracket Strategists understand, plan for, and potentially avoid AMT while maximizing retirement contributions and tax efficiency.

## Understanding AMT

### What Is AMT?
A parallel tax system designed to ensure high earners pay a minimum amount of tax. You calculate regular tax and AMT, then pay whichever is higher.

### 2025 AMT Key Numbers
```
AMT Exemption Amounts:
- Single: $85,700
- Married Filing Jointly: $133,300

Exemption Phase-out Begins:
- Single: $609,350
- Married Filing Jointly: $1,218,700

AMT Tax Rates:
- 26% on first $220,700 (all filers)
- 28% on amounts above
```

### AMT Calculation Simplified
```
Regular Taxable Income
+ AMT Preference Items
+ AMT Adjustments
= Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)
- AMT Exemption
= AMT Base
× AMT Rate (26% or 28%)
= Tentative Minimum Tax

If TMT > Regular Tax, pay the difference
```

## Common AMT Triggers

### Major Preference Items
1. **State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions**
   - Not allowed for AMT
   - Major trigger in high-tax states
   - $10,000 SALT cap helps reduce impact

2. **Personal Exemptions** (prior to 2018)
   - Previously a major trigger
   - Eliminated by tax reform
   - No longer an issue

3. **Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions**
   - Investment expenses
   - Tax preparation fees
   - Unreimbursed employee expenses
   - Not deductible for AMT

### Significant Adjustments

**Exercise of Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**
```
Example:
Exercise price: $10/share
Market value: $50/share
Shares exercised: 10,000
AMT adjustment: $400,000

Regular tax: $0 (no sale)
AMT impact: $104,000 (26% of $400,000)
```

**Private Activity Bond Interest**
- Tax-exempt for regular tax
- Taxable for AMT
- Check municipal bond holdings

**Depreciation Differences**
- Business property
- Real estate investments
- Different methods for AMT

## AMT Planning for Retirement Accounts

### How Retirement Contributions Help

**Traditional 401(k) Benefits:**
```
Gross income: $300,000
Traditional 401(k): $23,500
Reduced AGI: $276,500

Impact:
- Lowers regular tax
- Lowers AMT calculation
- May avoid AMT entirely
- Double benefit
```

**Why It Works:**
- Reduces AMTI directly
- Not a preference item
- No AMT adjustment required
- Universally beneficial

### Retirement Strategies Under AMT

**If Subject to AMT:**
1. Maximize all pre-tax contributions
2. Traditional clearly better than Roth
3. HSA contributions especially valuable
4. Consider deferred compensation

**If Near AMT Threshold:**
1. Model both calculations
2. Traditional contributions may prevent AMT
3. Time other income carefully
4. Avoid preference items

## AMT-Aware Tax Planning

### Bracket Coordination
```
Regular tax bracket: 32%
AMT rate: 26%
Effective marginal rate: 32%

But if deductions trigger AMT:
Loss of deduction benefit
Effective rate can exceed 32%
Complex calculations needed
```

### Multi-Year AMT Planning

**Year 1: In AMT**
- Defer state tax payments
- Accelerate income if at 26% AMT
- Avoid preference items
- Maximum retirement deferrals

**Year 2: Out of AMT**
- Take accumulated deductions
- Time preference items
- Normal optimization
- Credit for prior AMT

### AMT Credit Utilization
```
Prior year AMT paid: $20,000
Current year regular tax exceeds AMT
Available credit: $20,000
Reduces current tax dollar-for-dollar

Strategy: Don't waste the credit
Time income to use it efficiently
```

## ISO Planning Strategies

### Avoiding AMT on ISOs

**Strategy 1: Sell Same Year**
```
Exercise and sell immediately:
- No AMT adjustment
- Ordinary income on spread
- Higher regular tax
- But no AMT trap
```

**Strategy 2: Calculated Exercises**
```
Calculate AMT room:
Regular tax: $75,000
Tentative minimum tax: $65,000
AMT buffer: $10,000

Exercise ISOs to create $38,461 spread
(26% of $38,461 = $10,000)
Stay below AMT threshold
```

**Strategy 3: Disqualifying Disposition**
```
Exercise ISOs in Year 1
AMT adjustment created
Sell in Year 2 (before 1 year)
Disqualifying disposition
Reverses AMT adjustment
May recover AMT credit
```

## State Tax and AMT Interaction

### High-Tax State Challenges
```
California resident:
Income: $400,000
CA tax: $35,000 (not AMT deductible)
Property tax: $15,000 (limited deduction)

Major AMT risk
Traditional 401(k) more valuable
Consider residency planning
```

### Optimization Techniques
1. Time state payments carefully
2. Consider state credits vs. deductions
3. Understand state AMT rules
4. Plan moves around AMT

## AMT-Safe Investment Strategies

### Municipal Bonds
**Check for Private Activity:**
- Regular munis: AMT-safe
- Private activity bonds: AMT trigger
- Read prospectus carefully
- May need to rebalance

### Tax-Advantaged Investments
**Prefer in AMT Years:**
- Growth stocks (no dividends)
- Tax-managed funds
- Index funds
- Retirement accounts

**Avoid in AMT Years:**
- High-dividend stocks
- Actively traded funds
- Private activity bonds
- Complex partnerships

### December Checklist

- [ ] Identify which applies
- [ ] Adjust final payments

Remember: AMT adds complexity to tax planning, but understanding its rules allows Bracket Strategists to navigate successfully while maintaining optimal retirement savings strategies. When in doubt, model both calculations and plan accordingly.
