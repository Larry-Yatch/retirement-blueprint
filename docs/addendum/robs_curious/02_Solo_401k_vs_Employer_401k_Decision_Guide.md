## Overview
As someone considering ROBS, your current retirement contribution strategy matters. This guide helps you decide between participating in an employer 401(k) versus establishing a Solo 401(k) based on your employment situation.

## Understanding Your Options

### Employer 401(k)
**What It Is:**
- Company-sponsored retirement plan
- Available to W-2 employees
- Often includes employer match
- Limited investment options
- No direct control

**Key Features:**
- Automatic payroll deductions
- Potential employer contributions
- Loans often available
- Protected from creditors
- Professional management

### Solo 401(k)
**What It Is:**
- Individual 401(k) for self-employed
- No employees (except spouse)
- You control everything
- Broader investment options
- Higher contribution potential

**Key Features:**
- Employee AND employer contributions
- Greater contribution limits
- Investment flexibility
- Loan options available
- More administrative responsibility

## Decision Framework

### Scenario 1: W-2 Employee Only
**Clear Choice: Employer 401(k)**

**Reasoning:**
- Solo 401(k) not available without self-employment
- Employer match is free money
- Convenient payroll deductions
- No additional paperwork

**Action Steps:**
1. Maximize employer match
2. Consider full $23,500 deferral
3. Keep ROBS options open
4. Track vesting schedule

### Scenario 2: Self-Employed Only
**Clear Choice: Solo 401(k)**

**Benefits:**
- Higher contribution limits
- Double contribution capacity
- Complete investment control
- ROBS preparation opportunity

**Contribution Example (2025):**
- Employee deferral: $23,500
- Employer profit sharing: 25% of compensation
- Total potential: Up to $70,000
- Catch-up if 50+: Additional $7,500

### Scenario 3: Both W-2 and Self-Employed
**Analysis Required: Possibly Both**

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Employer match value**
   - Always capture full match
   - Calculate match benefit
   - Compare to Solo 401(k) flexibility

2. **Total contribution goals**
   - $23,500 employee limit is shared
   - Employer contributions are separate
   - Maximize both sources

3. **Income stability**
   - W-2 provides steady contributions
   - Self-employment may fluctuate
   - Diversification beneficial

## Optimization Strategies

### Maximum Contribution Strategy
**With Employer Match:**
1. Contribute to match threshold first
2. Evaluate remaining contribution room
3. Split between plans if beneficial
4. Maximize employer contributions in Solo

**Example:**
- Employer match: 3% of $100,000 = $3,000
- Your contribution for match: $3,000
- Remaining employee limit: $20,500
- Can defer remaining to either plan
- Solo 401(k) employer contribution separate

### ROBS Preparation Strategy
**Focus Areas:**
1. Maintain rollover eligibility
2. Build maximum capital
3. Keep accounts organized
4. Document everything

**Considerations:**
- Both can roll to ROBS later
- Solo 401(k) offers practice
- Employer 401(k) often larger balance
- Consolidation before ROBS helpful
