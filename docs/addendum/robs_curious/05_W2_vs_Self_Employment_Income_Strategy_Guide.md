## Understanding Income Types

### W-2 Employment Income

- Social Security/Medicare automatic
- Unemployment insurance coverage
- Workers' compensation protection
- Employer benefit eligibility

**Retirement Options:**
- Employer 401(k) plan
- Employer match potential
- Automatic payroll deductions
- Limited investment choices
- No additional paperwork

### Self-Employment Income
**Characteristics:**

## Tax Optimization Strategies

### Self-Employment Tax Planning

**Understanding the 15.3% SE Tax:**
```
Gross Self-Employment Income:     $100,000
Less: Business Expenses:         -$20,000
Net Self-Employment Income:       $80,000
SE Tax (92.35% × 15.3%):        $11,304
Income Tax on Net:               Variable
```

**Reduction Strategies:**
1. **Maximize Business Deductions**
   - Home office
   - Vehicle expenses
   - Equipment/supplies
   - Professional services

2. **Solo 401(k) Contributions**
   - Reduces taxable income
   - Not SE tax base
   - Retirement savings
   - Loan options

3. **Entity Selection**
   - Sole proprietor: Simple, full SE tax
   - S-Corp: Salary/distribution split
   - LLC: Flexibility
   - C-Corp: ROBS compatible

### W-2 Income Optimization

**Maximizing Benefits:**
- Capture full employer match
- Use pre-tax benefits (HSA, FSA)
- Optimize withholdings
- Time bonuses strategically

## Retirement Contribution Strategies

### Scenario 1: Primary W-2, Side Self-Employment

**Income Example:**
- W-2 income: $100,000
- Self-employment: $20,000

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. Maximize employer match first
2. Max employee deferrals ($23,500)
3. Solo 401(k) employer contribution (25% of SE)
4. Total retirement: $28,500+

**Tax Savings:**
- 401(k) deferrals: $23,500 × tax rate
- Solo employer: $5,000 × tax rate
- Total reduction in taxable income: $28,500

### Scenario 2: Equal W-2 and Self-Employment

**Income Example:**
- W-2 income: $75,000
- Self-employment: $75,000

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. Get employer match
2. Evaluate which 401(k) is better
3. Consider splitting deferrals
4. Maximize employer contributions
5. Coordinate strategies

**Contribution Allocation:**
```
Employer match (3% of $75k):      $2,250
Employee deferral to match:       $2,250
Remaining deferral capacity:     $21,250
Solo employer contribution:      $18,750
Total retirement savings:        $44,500
```

### Scenario 3: Transitioning to Full Self-Employment

**Phased Approach:**
- Year 1: 80% W-2, 20% SE
- Year 2: 60% W-2, 40% SE
- Year 3: 40% W-2, 60% SE
- Year 4: 100% SE

**Strategy Evolution:**
1. Start Solo 401(k) early
2. Maintain both plans
3. Shift contributions gradually
4. Prepare for ROBS eligibility
