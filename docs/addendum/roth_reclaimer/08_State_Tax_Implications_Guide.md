$100,000 conversion

If convert before move:
Federal tax: $24,000
CA state tax: $13,300
Total: $37,300

Federal tax: $24,000
NV state tax: $0
Total: $24,000

```

Option 3: Source to new state if possible

Planning critical for optimization
```

## State Tax Calculations

### Multi-State Scenarios

**Example 1: CA to TX Move**
```
January-June: CA resident
July-December: TX resident
$120,000 annual income
$100,000 Roth conversion in August

Result:
- CA taxes $60,000 (time-based)
- TX taxes conversion (0%)
- Significant savings achieved
```

**Example 2: Work in Multiple States**
```
Live in: New Jersey (10.75%)
Work in: New York (10.9%)
Roth Conversion: Sourced to residence

Tax Impact:
- NJ taxes full conversion
- Credit for taxes paid to NY on wages
- No double taxation on conversion
```

### State Tax Withholding

**Mandatory Withholding States:**
- California: 3.3% default
- Maine: 5%
- Vermont: 30% of federal
- Check your state

**Voluntary Withholding:**
- Most states optional
- Can elect percentage
- Simplifies payment
- Reduces quarterly needs

## Planning Strategies

### Strategy 1: Geographic Arbitrage
**Retirement Relocation:**
```
Working years: High-tax state
Retirement: Low/no-tax state
Strategy: Delay conversions until move

Example:
Age 60: Retire from NY job
Age 61: Establish FL residency
Age 62-70: Convert aggressively
Savings: 10.9% per dollar converted
```

### Strategy 2: Split Residency
**Snowbird Approach:**
```
6 months + 1 day: Florida
Just under 6 months: New York

Establish FL domicile:
- FL driver's license
- FL voter registration
- FL homestead
- Document everything

Result: FL resident for tax purposes
```

### Strategy 3: Source Income Planning
**For Multiple State Exposure:**
```
Types of income:
- Wages: Sourced to work state
- Retirement: Sourced to residence
- Investments: Sourced to residence
- Roth conversions: Residence state

Optimize by timing and location
```

## State-Specific Considerations

### Retirement Income Exclusions

**Research Your State**

### Estate and Inheritance Taxes

**States with Estate Tax:**

Conversion may save overall
