   - After-tax contributions
   - Tax-free growth
   - No RMDs

3. Taxable
   - Flexibility
   - Capital gains rates
   - Step-up at death

Ideal allocation varies by situation
```

### Strategic Account Location
```

## Early Retirement Tax Strategies (Before 65)

- Part-time work

72(t) Calculation methods:

```
Keep income below thresholds:
2025 limits (% of poverty level):
100-150%: Maximum subsidies

200-300%: Moderate subsidies
300-400%: Minimal subsidies

Strategies:

- Realize capital losses
- Defer income
- Manage conversions carefully
```

### Roth Conversion Sweet Spot
```
Ages 60-65 often ideal:
- Lower income years
- Before Social Security
- Before RMDs
- Time for growth

Fill up tax brackets:
12% bracket: Convert aggressively
22% bracket: Still favorable
24% bracket: Case-by-case
32%+: Usually wait
```

## Retirement Phase Tax Management (65+)

- Over $44,000: Up to 85% taxable

Provisional income = AGI + Tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS
```

### Coordinating Income Sources
```
Tax-efficient withdrawal order:

Annual tax planning:
