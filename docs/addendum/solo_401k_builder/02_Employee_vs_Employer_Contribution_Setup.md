## Business Structure Impact

### Sole Proprietorship/Single-Member LLC

**Employee Contribution Calculation:**
```
Net Business Income:         $100,000

Adjusted Income:             $92,935
Employee Contribution:       Up to $23,500
```

**Employer Contribution Calculation:**
```
Adjusted Income:             $92,935
× 20% Rate:                 × 0.20
Employer Contribution:       $18,587
```

**Total Possible: $42,087**

### S-Corporation

**Employee Contribution:**
```
W-2 Wages:                   $60,000
Employee Deferral:           Up to $23,500
(Limited by wages)
```

**Employer Contribution:**
```
W-2 Wages:                   $60,000
× 25% Rate:                  × 0.25
Employer Contribution:       $15,000
```

**Total Possible: $38,500**

### C-Corporation (ROBS)

**Similar to S-Corp but:**
- Must pay reasonable salary
- 25% of W-2 wages for employer
- Consider profit distributions
- Double taxation on profits

## Contribution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maximum Total Contributions
**Goal:** Reach $70,000 combined limit

**Sole Proprietor Example:**
```
Required Net Income:         $245,642
Employee Contribution:       $23,500
Employer Contribution:       $46,500
Total Contributions:         $70,000
```

**S-Corp Example:**
```
Required W-2 Wages:          $186,000
Employee Contribution:       $23,500
Employer Contribution:       $46,500 (25% of $186k)
Total Contributions:         $70,000
```

### Strategy 2: Balanced Approach
**Goal:** Optimize taxes and savings

**Example Calculation:**
```
Net Business Income:         $120,000
Target Savings Rate:         25%
Target Contribution:         $30,000

Allocation:
- Employee Deferral:         $20,000
- Employer Profit Share:     $10,000
- Tax Savings:              ~$9,000
```

### Strategy 3: Roth Maximization
**Goal:** Maximum tax-free growth

**Approach:**
```
Employee Contribution:       $23,500 (all Roth)
Employer Contribution:       $15,000 (must be traditional)
Total:                      $38,500
Roth Percentage:            61%
```

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Calculate Maximum Contributions

**Sole Proprietor Worksheet:**
```
1. Net Business Income:           $_______
2. Less: 1/2 SE Tax:             $_______
3. Adjusted Income:              $_______
4. Employee Deferral Limit:      $23,500*
5. Employer Contribution (20%):   $_______
6. Total Maximum:                $_______

*Or catch-up limits if eligible
```

**S-Corp Worksheet:**
```
1. W-2 Wages:                    $_______
2. Employee Deferral Limit:      $23,500*
3. Employer Contribution (25%):   $_______
4. Combined Limit Check:         $70,000
5. Total Maximum:                $_______

*Or catch-up limits if eligible
```

### Step 2: Determine Contribution Mix

**Decision Factors:**
1. Current tax bracket
2. Expected future tax rate
3. Other retirement accounts
4. Cash flow needs
5. Estate planning goals

**Traditional vs. Roth Employee:**
| Factor | Favors Traditional | Favors Roth |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Current tax bracket | High (32%+) | Low (10-22%) |
| Future tax expectation | Lower | Higher |
| Time to retirement | <10 years | >20 years |
| Other pre-tax savings | Low | High |
| Estate planning | Less important | Critical |

### Step 3: Set Up Contribution Schedule

**Employee Deferrals:**
- **If W-2**: Through payroll each period
- **If 1099**: Quarterly or annually
- **Amount**: Fixed dollar or percentage
- **Type**: Traditional, Roth, or split

**Employer Contributions:**
- **Timing**: Can wait until tax filing
- **Frequency**: Annual typical
- **Amount**: Based on profits
- **Deadline**: Tax return due date + extensions
