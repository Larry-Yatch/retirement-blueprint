# RMD Planning and Preparation Guide

## Overview
Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin at age 73, forcing taxable withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts. For those in catch-up years, strategic planning can minimize the tax impact of future RMDs while maximizing retirement income flexibility.

## Understanding RMD Rules

### Current RMD Age Requirements
```
Born before 1951: RMDs started at 70½
Born 1951-1959: RMDs start at 73
Born 1960 or later: RMDs start at 75

Key change: SECURE Act 2.0 pushed back RMD age
More time for planning and conversions
```

### Accounts Subject to RMDs
**Required:**
- Traditional IRA
- Rollover IRA
- SEP-IRA
- SIMPLE IRA
- Traditional 401(k)
- 403(b)
- 457(b)

**Not Required:**
- Roth IRA (owner)
- Roth 401(k) (starting 2024)
- HSA
- Taxable accounts

### RMD Calculation Formula
```
RMD = Account Balance ÷ Life Expectancy Factor

Example at age 73:
Account balance: $500,000
Life expectancy factor: 26.5
RMD = $500,000 ÷ 26.5 = $18,868
```

## Pre-RMD Planning Strategies (Ages 50-72)

### Strategy 1: Aggressive Roth Conversions
**The Window of Opportunity:**
```
Age 60-72: Golden conversion years
- Often lower income
- Before Social Security
- Before RMDs
- Lower tax brackets available

Example conversion plan:
Age 60-65: Convert $50,000/year
Age 66-72: Convert $75,000/year
Total converted: $775,000
RMDs eliminated on this amount
```

### Strategy 2: Strategic Account Withdrawals
**Reduce Future RMD Base:**
```
Age 65-72 withdrawal strategy:
- Take from Traditional IRA first
- Even if don't need income
- Reduce account balance
- Lower future RMDs
- Fill up low tax brackets
```

### Strategy 3: Qualified Charitable Distributions
**Starting at Age 70½:**
```
QCD Benefits:
- Up to $100,000 annually
- Direct to charity
- Counts toward RMD
- Not included in income
- Better than deduction

Planning: Start QCDs before RMDs
Reduce account balance
Lower future RMDs
```

## RMD Optimization Techniques

### Managing Multiple Accounts

**IRA Aggregation Rule:**
```
Multiple IRAs:
IRA 1: $200,000 (RMD: $7,547)
IRA 2: $150,000 (RMD: $5,660)
IRA 3: $100,000 (RMD: $3,774)
Total RMD: $16,981

Can take entire $16,981 from any IRA
Strategic opportunity for planning
```

**401(k) Separation Rule:**
```
Must take RMDs separately from:
- Each 401(k) plan
- Each 403(b) plan
- Cannot aggregate
- Still working exception

Strategy: Roll to IRA for flexibility
```

### Tax Bracket Management
```
RMD Tax Planning:
Base income: $40,000
Social Security: $25,000
RMD required: $30,000
Total income: $95,000

Options to reduce tax:
1. QCD portion: $10,000
2. Harvest losses: $5,000
3. Increase deductions
4. Result: Stay in lower bracket
```

## Common RMD Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Large Traditional IRA
```
Age 73, IRA balance: $2,000,000
First RMD: $75,472
Problem: Pushes into higher bracket

Solutions implemented at 60:
- Converted $500,000 to Roth
- QCDs of $50,000 annually
- Current balance: $1,200,000
- RMD now: $45,283
- Saved: $30,189 annually
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Account Types
```
Age 73 with:
Traditional IRA: $400,000
401(k) from old employer: $300,000
Current employer 401(k): $200,000

Strategy:
- Take RMD from Traditional IRA
- Roll old 401(k) to IRA
- Delay current 401(k) RMD (still working)
- Maximum flexibility
```

### Scenario 3: Charitable Inclinations
```
Age 73, strong charitable desire:
RMD required: $40,000
Annual charitable giving: $20,000

Optimal approach:
- QCD $20,000 directly
- Take $20,000 as income
- Reduces taxable income by $20,000
- Better than itemizing
```

## Year One RMD Special Rules

### The First Year Option
```
Turn 73 in 2025:
First RMD due: April 1, 2026
Can delay but careful:

If delay to 2026:
- 2025 RMD due April 1
- 2026 RMD due December 31
- Double RMDs in one year
- Tax bracket impact

Usually better: Take in year turn 73
```

### Calculating First RMD
```
Use December 31 balance from year before turning 73:

Example:
Turn 73 in 2025
Use 12/31/2024 balance: $650,000
Life expectancy at 73: 26.5
First RMD: $24,528
```

## RMD Reduction Strategies

### Pre-73 Checklist
- [ ] Calculate projected RMDs
- [ ] Model tax impact
- [ ] Plan Roth conversions
- [ ] Consider QCD strategy
- [ ] Optimize account types
- [ ] Review beneficiaries
- [ ] Consolidate accounts
- [ ] Plan withdrawal sequence

### Annual RMD Management

**Timing Considerations:**
```
Best practices:
- Not too early (lose growth)
- Not too late (penalties)
- Consider tax withholding
- Coordinate with other income
- December deadline critical

Optimal: Take monthly or quarterly
Smooth income and withholding
```

### Investment Considerations
```
RMD-Friendly Portfolio:
- Income-producing assets
- Dividend stocks
- Bonds maturing
- Money market for RMD cash
- Avoid selling in down markets

Strategy: Build RMD reserve
Keep 1-2 years in stable assets
```

## RMD Penalties and Compliance

### Penalty for Missing RMD
```
SECURE Act 2.0 reduced penalty:
Old penalty: 50% of shortfall
New penalty: 25% of shortfall
If corrected quickly: 10%

Example:
Required RMD: $30,000
Amount taken: $20,000
Shortfall: $10,000
Penalty: $2,500 (or $1,000 if corrected)
```

### Avoiding Penalties
**Systems and Safeguards:**
1. Calendar alerts for December
2. Automatic distributions
3. Work with custodian
4. Double-check calculations
5. Document everything

## Coordinating with Social Security

### Tax Torpedo Zone
```
RMDs can trigger SS taxation:
Income without RMD: $35,000
Social Security: $24,000
50% of SS taxable: $12,000

Add $20,000 RMD:
Now 85% of SS taxable: $20,400
Effective tax rate jumps
Plan carefully
```

### Mitigation Strategies
- Take IRA withdrawals before SS
- Delay Social Security
- Convert to Roth early
- Use QCDs
- Manage other income

## Advanced RMD Planning

### Inherited IRA Implications
```
Spouse inherits:
- Can treat as own
- Delay RMDs until 73
- More planning time

Non-spouse inherits:
- 10-year rule
- No annual RMDs
- Must empty by year 10
- Plan accordingly
```

### Working Past 73
```
Still-working exception:
- Current employer 401(k) only
- Must not own >5%
- Can delay RMDs
- Until retirement
- IRA RMDs still required

Strategy: Keep money in 401(k)
Roll IRAs to 401(k) if allowed
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **RMDs force taxable income** - Plan to minimize
2. **Age 60-72 critical** - Conversion window
3. **Multiple strategies available** - Use them all
4. **QCDs powerful tool** - Starting at 70½
5. **Penalties severe** - Never miss RMD
6. **Coordination essential** - With all retirement income
7. **Start planning early** - More options available

Remember: RMDs can significantly impact retirement taxes and cash flow. The catch-up years (50-72) provide crucial planning opportunities to reduce future RMDs through strategic conversions, withdrawals, and charitable giving strategies.
