## Maximization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Front-Load Contributions
**Maximize Time in Market:**

Annual limit: $31,000 (age 50+)
Monthly: $2,583
Better approach: Front-load

January-June: $5,167/month

6 months extra growth
```

**Implementation:**
- Calculate max contribution
- Divide by fewer months
- Ensure match isn't lost
- Monitor carefully

### Strategy 2: Bonus Optimization
**Year-End Bonus Strategy:**
```
Expected bonus: $40,000
Regular contribution: $25,000 already
Catch-up room: $6,000

Action: 
- Elect 100% of bonus to 401(k)
- Stop at $31,000 total
- Maximize tax deferral
```

### Strategy 3: Two-Income Coordination
**Spousal Maximization:**
```
Both spouses age 50+:
Spouse 1: $31,000 catch-up max
Spouse 2: $31,000 catch-up max
Combined: $62,000 annual

Over 10 years: $620,000
Plus growth: $1,000,000+
```

## Age-Based Optimization

### Age 50-59 Strategy
**Building Momentum:**
```
Typical scenario:
- Kids through college
- Mortgage nearly paid
- Peak earning years
- More disposable income

Action Plan:
1. Immediate increase to catch-up max
2. Automate contributions
3. Increase with raises
4. Use windfalls
```

### Age 60-63 Super Catch-Up
**Maximizing the Boost:**
```
New limit: $34,750
Additional $3,750/year
4 years × $3,750 = $15,000 extra

Strategy:
- Plan for increase
- Adjust budget now
- Front-load if possible
- Consider Roth option
```

### Age 64+ Considerations
**Final Push:**
```
Approaching retirement:
- Last chance for deferrals
- RMDs coming at 73
- Tax planning critical
- Roth conversions next

Priorities:
1. Max all catch-up
2. Consider Roth 401(k)
3. Plan distributions
4. Coordinate with SS
```

## Roth vs. Traditional Catch-Up

### Decision Framework
**Traditional Catch-Up Benefits:**
- Immediate tax deduction
- More take-home pay
- Larger contributions possible
- Good for high earners

**Roth Catch-Up Benefits:**
- Tax-free growth
- No RMDs
- Estate planning advantages
- Good if expect higher future rates

### Split Strategy
```
Total catch-up: $31,000

Option 1: All traditional
- Max current deduction
- Higher current cash flow

Option 2: 50/50 split
- $15,500 traditional
- $15,500 Roth
- Tax diversification

Option 3: All Roth
- Maximum tax-free growth
- Requires more cash flow
```

## Cash Flow Management

### Finding the Money
**Common Sources:**
```
1. Kids off payroll
   - College done: +$20,000/year
   - Off insurance: +$3,000/year
   
2. Mortgage paid off
   - Payment was: $2,000/month
   - Redirect to 401(k): $24,000/year

3. Reduce lifestyle inflation
   - Skip car upgrade: $500/month
   - Dining out less: $300/month
```

### Budget Adjustment Template
```
MONTHLY CASH FLOW ANALYSIS

Previous expenses eliminated:
- Child expenses: $1,500
- College savings: $1,000
- Extra debt payments: $500
Total available: $3,000

401(k) catch-up: $2,583
Remaining: $417 (emergency buffer)
```

## Employer Match Optimization

### Understanding True-Ups
**Problem:** Front-loading may miss match
**Solution:** True-up provisions

```
Example without true-up:
- 3% match on each paycheck
- Front-load in 6 months
- Miss 6 months of match
- Lost: $2,250 (on $150k salary)

With true-up:
- Employer calculates annually
- Contributes missed match
- No penalty for front-loading
```

### Match Maximization Tactics
1. **Know your plan rules**
   - Per-paycheck vs annual
   - True-up availability
   - Vesting schedules
   - Match formulas

2. **Optimize timing**
   - If no true-up: Spread evenly
   - If true-up: Front-load away
   - Track carefully
   - Verify receipts

## Common Catch-Up Mistakes

### Contribution Errors
❌ Not starting at 50
❌ Forgetting spouse eligibility
❌ Missing employer match
❌ Poor timing choices
❌ Not adjusting for raises

### Planning Mistakes
❌ No cash flow analysis
❌ Ignoring tax impacts
❌ All in one account type
