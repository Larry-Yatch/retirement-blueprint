# Annual Review and Optimization Guide

## Overview
Building wealth isn't a "set it and forget it" process. Annual reviews ensure you're maximizing opportunities, adapting to life changes, and staying on track for retirement goals. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing your retirement accounts yearly.

## Why Annual Reviews Matter

### The Cost of Neglect
```
Common consequences of no review:
- Missing employer match changes
- Paying unnecessary fees
- Wrong asset allocation
- Outdated beneficiaries
- Lost tax opportunities
- Forgotten accounts
- Suboptimal strategies

Example impact:
Missing 1% fee for 30 years = 25% less money
Wrong allocation for age = Unnecessary risk/loss
Outdated beneficiary = Estate nightmare
```
