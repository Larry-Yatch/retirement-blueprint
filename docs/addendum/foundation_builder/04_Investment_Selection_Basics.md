   - Sell everything (Low)

2. When do I need this money?

   - <10 years (Conservative)

3. Can I sleep at night?
   - Market drops don't bother me
   - Some worry but stay course
   - Lose sleep over losses

### Historical Returns and Risk
```
Asset Class | Average Return | Worst Year | Best Year
Stocks      | 10%           | -37%       | +38%
Bonds       | 5%            | -13%       | +33%
50/50 Mix   | 7.5%          | -22%       | +28%
Cash        | 3%            | 0%         | +15%

## Common Investment Mistakes

### Selection Mistakes
❌ Choosing based on past performance
❌ Too many funds (over-diversification)
❌ All company stock
❌ Chasing hot sectors
❌ Analysis paralysis

### Behavioral Mistakes
❌ Panic selling in downturns
❌ Market timing attempts
❌ Never rebalancing
❌ Set and forget forever
❌ Following coworker advice

### Fee Mistakes
❌ Ignoring expense ratios
❌ Multiple funds doing same thing
❌ High-fee active funds
❌ Not reading fund details
❌ Paying for advice not needed

## Understanding Fees

### Expense Ratios Matter
```
Impact of fees over 30 years:
Starting balance: $10,000
Annual return: 7%

0.05% fee: Final = $70,000
0.50% fee: Final = $57,000
1.50% fee: Final = $43,000

High fees cost you $27,000!
```

### What's Reasonable?
- Index funds: 0.03% - 0.20%
- Target-date funds: 0.10% - 0.30%
- Active funds: 0.50% - 1.50%
- Aim for total under 0.50%

## Rebalancing Your Portfolio

### Why Rebalance?
- Maintains risk level
- Forces buy low, sell high
- Keeps strategy on track
- Manages emotions

### When to Rebalance
**Time-based:** Annually or semi-annually
**Threshold-based:** When off by 5%+
**Combination:** Annual check, act if needed

### How to Rebalance
```
Example: Target 70/30 stocks/bonds
Current: 80/20 (stocks did well)

Actions:
1. Sell 10% stocks
2. Buy 10% bonds
3. Back to 70/30
4. Or direct new contributions to bonds
```

## Special Considerations
