## Coordinating IRA with 401(k)

### The Power of Both
```
Example: $75,000 income, age 35

401(k) contribution: $15,000 (20%)
IRA contribution: $7,000
Total tax-advantaged: $22,000

Without IRA: Miss $7,000 annually
30 years lost growth: $650,000+
```

### Optimal Contribution Order
```
1. 401(k) to full match (free money)
2. Max HSA if eligible ($4,300/$9,300)
3. Max Roth IRA ($7,000)
4. Back to 401(k) ($23,500 max)
5. Consider backdoor Roth
6. Taxable investments

Why this order:
- Guarantees match
- HSA triple tax benefit
- Roth IRA flexibility
- 401(k) higher limits
```

### Strategic Coordination Examples

#### Scenario 1: Early Career
```
Income: $50,000
401(k) match: 50% up to 6%

Strategy:
- 401(k): 6% = $3,000 (get $1,500 match)
- Roth IRA: $7,000 (low tax bracket)
- Total savings: $11,500 (23% rate)

Benefits:
- Full match captured
- Tax diversification
- Roth growth potential
```

#### Scenario 2: Mid-Career
```
Income: $100,000
401(k) match: 3%

Strategy:
- 401(k): $15,000 (15%)
- Traditional IRA: $7,000 (deductible)
- Total savings: $22,000

Benefits:
- Current tax reduction
- Strong savings rate
- Flexibility options
```

#### Scenario 3: High Earner
```
Income: $200,000
Over Roth limits

Strategy:
- Max 401(k): $23,500
- Backdoor Roth IRA: $7,000
- After-tax 401(k) if available

Benefits:
- Maximum tax advantage
- Access to Roth
- Building wealth efficiently
```

## Choosing Between IRA Types

### Decision Framework
```
Current Tax Bracket Analysis:
10-12% bracket → Strong Roth
22% bracket → Lean Roth
24% bracket → Consider both
32%+ bracket → Traditional preferred

Time Horizon:
30+ years → Roth advantage
20 years → Balanced approach
10 years → Traditional often better
Already retired → Depends on situation
```

### When to Use Both
```
Split Strategy Benefits:
- Tax diversification
- Flexibility in retirement
- Hedge against law changes
- Optimize withdrawals

Example Split:
401(k): Traditional (larger amount)
IRA: Roth (smaller amount)
Result: Best of both worlds
```
