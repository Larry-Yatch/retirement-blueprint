Session Summary: Profile Tuning & Testing Lessons Learned

  Initial Context

  - Project: Retirement Blueprint - tuning allocation profiles
  - Deadline: 3 days
  - Starting Point: Continuing Profile 2 (ROBS Curious) tuning
  from previous session
  - Previous Work: Had created improved testing infrastructure
  that immediately failed

  Major Issues Discovered

  1. The $300/$300/$300 Equal Split Problem

  Symptom: All domains getting equal allocations regardless of
  importance
  Root Causes:
  - Missing investment scoring fields (investment_involvement,
  investment_time, investment_confidence)
  - Missing domain importance fields (retirement_importance,
  education_importance, health_importance)
  - Missing years_until_need fields

  Fix: Added all ~92 required fields to test data

  2. Profile 7 401(k) Allocation Bug

  Symptom: 401(k) vehicles generated but receiving $0
  allocation
  Root Cause: 401(k) match was being inserted AFTER HSA in
  vehicle priority order
  // BROKEN: Insert after HSA
  const hsaIndex = updatedOrder.findIndex(v => v.name ===
  'HSA');
  const insertIndex = hsaIndex >= 0 ? hsaIndex + 1 : 0;

  // FIXED: Insert at beginning (highest priority)
  updatedOrder.unshift(matchVehicle);
  Key Learning: Employer match should ALWAYS be first priority
  (free money)

  3. Test Data Inconsistency Issues

  Problem: "Lazy copying" between profiles created
  contradictions
  - Profile 2 copied Profile 7's base data
  - Had education_importance=1 despite having 2 kids
  - Total_Monthly_Savings_Capacity not recalculated when income
   changed
  - Missing CESA goals for families with children

  Solution: Created complete, profile-specific test suites with
   coherent data

  Critical Lessons Learned

  1. Testing Approach

  - What Failed: Creating complex testing infrastructure
  without running it
  - What Worked: Simple, direct test execution with immediate
  feedback
  - Key Quote: "We have not run a test that has worked the
  first time"

  2. Data Completeness vs Data Coherence

  - Having all fields isn't enough - they must make sense
  together
  - A 52-year-old should have CATCH_UP_ELIGIBLE=TRUE
  - Families with kids should have education_importance > 1
  - Income/tax/savings calculations must align

  3. Domain Knowledge

  - HSA in retirement order is intentional (triple tax
  advantage)
  - Don't remove features without understanding their purpose
  - The universal engine works fine - testing was the issue

  4. Development Process

  What We Should Have Done:
  - Test immediately after each change
  - Use the same working pattern (like testProfile7All)
  - Get actual output before building on assumptions
  - Recognize when we're over-engineering

  Tools Created

  1. Test_Data_Validator.js

  - Validates test data consistency
  - Catches issues like age/flag mismatches
  - Auto-fix function for common problems

  2. Complete_Test_Suites_Fixed.js

  - Profile-specific complete base data
  - No cross-profile references
  - Coherent scenario overrides

  3. Debug_Helpers.js

  - Vehicle order visualization
  - Allocation trace debugging
  - Common issues checker

  Current Status

  âœ… Completed

  - Profile 7 (Foundation Builder) - Fixed and tested
  - Profile 2 (ROBS Curious) - Fixed and tested
  - Test data validation infrastructure
  - Complete test suites for Profiles 2, 4, 7

  ðŸŸ¡ Profile 2 Final Test Results

  W-2 Employee with Family:
  - CESA: $333/mo âœ…
  - Education Total: $866/mo
  - Proper domain weighting based on importance

  Self-Employed:
  - Solo 401(k): $1396/mo âœ…
  - No education (no kids)
  - Health prioritized

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

  1. Test Profile 4 (Roth Reclaimer) with fixed test suite
  2. Create placeholder test suites for remaining profiles
  3. Continue tuning profiles in priority order: 5, 6, 9, 3, 1,
   8

  Key Takeaway

  The universal allocation engine was never broken. Our testing
   approach was flawed due to incomplete/inconsistent test data
   and over-engineered testing infrastructure. Simple, direct
  testing with complete, coherent data works best.
