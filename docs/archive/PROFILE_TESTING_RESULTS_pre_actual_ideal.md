# Profile Testing Results & Issues Tracker

*Last Updated: August 27, 2025*

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: System Working As Designed, But Design Doesn't Match User Expectations

**The "bug" is actually a feature!** The system intentionally treats allocation percentage as ADDITIONAL savings on top of existing contributions. This causes 2-3x "over-allocation" for profiles with seeded contributions.

**Example**: User currently contributing $4,000/mo to Solo 401k says "I want to save 25% of my income"
- **User expects**: $2,000/mo total (25% of $8,000 income)
- **System calculates**: $4,000 (existing) + $2,000 (25% additional) = $6,000/mo total

**Affected Profiles**: 1 (ROBS), 3 (Solo 401k), 8 (Biz Owner) - all profiles that seed existing contributions

**Design Decision Needed**: Should allocation % mean total or additional savings rate?

## Testing Summary

| Profile | Status | Test Result | Issues Found | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 - ROBS In Use | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues | Working but allocation mismatch | Seeding logic causes 2x allocation | High |

| 5 - Bracket Strategist | ‚úÖ Passed | Working correctly | None | - |
| 6 - Catch-Up | ‚úÖ Passed | Working correctly | None | - |
| 7 - Foundation Builder | ‚úÖ Passed | Working correctly | 20% minimum enforced | - |
| 8 - Biz Owner | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues | Working but allocation mismatch | Seeding logic causes 2x allocation | High |
| 9 - Late Stage | ‚úÖ Passed | Working correctly | None | - |

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Working Profiles (5 of 9):
- **Profiles 2, 5, 6, 7, 9** all work correctly
- These profiles either don't use seeds or use them correctly (for employer matches only)
- Allocations match expected values perfectly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Profiles with Issues (4 of 9):

#### 1. Seeding Logic Problem (Profiles 1, 3, 8):
- **Root Cause**: These profiles incorrectly seed user-specified contribution amounts
- **Effect**: System treats seeds as existing contributions and adds user's percentage ON TOP
- **Result**: 2-3x over-allocation

**Affected Code Locations**:
- Profile 1: Line 1052 - `seeds.Retirement['ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution'] = annualProfitDistribution / 12;`
- Profile 3: Line 921 - `seeds.Retirement['Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employee'] = annualFuture/12;`
- Profile 8: Lines 2044-2050 - Seeds Group 401(k) Employee contributions

#### 2. Form Mapping Problem (Profile 4):
- Test data uses wrong ex_q field numbers
- Profile expects ex_q1/2 but test provides ex_q5/6
- Results in Backdoor Roth logic not triggering

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile 4: Roth Reclaimer (ISSUES FOUND)
**Test Date**: August 27, 2025

**Scenarios Tested**:
1. High Income Backdoor ($200k income)
   - Expected: "Backdoor Roth IRA"

## Common Patterns Observed

### ‚úÖ Working Well:
1. **Investment Scoring**: No equal $333 splits seen (fields are working)
2. **Domain Allocation**: Properly based on importance scores
3. **Vehicle Generation**: Core logic working for most profiles
4. **20% Minimum**: Consistently enforced across all profiles
5. **Overflow Vehicles**: Education Bank and Health Bank appearing correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found:
1. **Form Mapping**: Profile 4 has incorrect ex_q field mappings in test data
2. **Missing Test Data**: Some profiles need specific ex_q values to trigger features

### üìù Notes:
- The 20% minimum savings rate is enforced by `CONFIG.OPTIMIZED_SAVINGS_RATE: 0.20`
- This is a feature, not a bug - ensures adequate retirement savings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile 1: ROBS In Use (ISSUES FOUND)
**Test Date**: August 27, 2025

**Scenario Tested**:
- Age 45, Self-employed, $150k income
- Using ROBS with C-Corp
- 30% allocation requested

**Results**:
- Expected: $2,700/mo (30% of $9,000)
- Actual: $6,866/mo
- Difference: +$4,166/mo (154% overage)

**Working Features**:
- ‚úÖ ROBS Solo 401(k) Profit Distribution vehicle generated
- ‚úÖ Backdoor Roth IRA correctly added
- ‚úÖ HSA allocation working
- ‚úÖ No equal $333 splits

**Issue Identified**:
1. **Unlimited ROBS Profit Distribution**: The profile is allocating $5,056/mo to ROBS Solo 401(k)
   - This appears to be treating profit distributions as unlimited
   - Test specified $50,000 annual ($4,167/mo) in ex_q6
   - System allocated more than the specified amount

**Hypothesis**: The ROBS profit distribution vehicle may not be respecting the ex_q6 limit, or there's additional logic adding employer contributions beyond the specified profit distribution.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile 3: Solo 401k Builder (ISSUES FOUND)
**Test Date**: August 27, 2025

**Scenario Tested**:
- Age 40, Self-employed LLC, $120k income
- 25% allocation requested
- Solo 401k with $23,500 employee + $25,000 employer contributions

**Results**:
- Expected: $2,000/mo (25% of $8,000)
- Actual: $6,042/mo
- Difference: +$4,042/mo (202% overage)

**Working Features**:
- ‚úÖ Solo 401(k) Employee/Employer split correctly generated
- ‚úÖ Employee contribution: $1,958/mo ($23,500 annual)
- ‚úÖ Employer contribution: $2,733/mo ($32,796 annual)
- ‚úÖ CESA allocation for child
- ‚úÖ HSA, Roth IRA, and Backdoor Roth IRA working

**Issue Identified**:
1. **Over-allocation**: System is allocating 3x the requested amount
   - Solo 401k alone is $4,691/mo (234% of requested $2,000)
   - Test specified $48,500 annual total in ex_q6
   - Actual Solo 401k allocation is $56,296 annual

**Pattern Emerging**: Both Profile 1 and 3 are significantly over-allocating. This suggests the universal allocation engine might be treating certain retirement vehicles as "unlimited" or applying additional logic beyond the user's allocation percentage.

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: 
The issue is not with the universal allocation engine but with how Profiles 1 and 3 are using the "seeds" mechanism:

1. **Profile 1**: Seeds $4,167/mo from ex_q6 (line 1052 in Code.js)
   ```javascript
   seeds.Retirement['ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution'] = annualProfitDistribution / 12;
   ```

2. **Profile 3**: Seeds $4,042/mo from ex_q6 (line 921 in Code.js)
   ```javascript
   seeds.Retirement['Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employee'] = annualFuture/12;
   ```

3. **The Problem**: The `computeNetPool` function treats seeds as EXISTING contributions and adds the user's allocation percentage ON TOP:
   - Calculates current savings rate from seeds
   - Adds user's requested percentage to that
   - Results in massive over-allocation

4. **Why Others Work**: Profiles 2, 4, and 7 don't seed large contribution amounts - they only seed employer matches or leave seeds empty.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: This is NOT a bug - it's the intended design!

The `computeNetPool` function documentation clearly states:
- "Computes how much 'new' savings to allocate each month"
- "treating userPct as an increment over their current savings rate"
- "@param userPct ‚Äî additional % they want to save"

The system intentionally treats allocation percentage as ADDITIONAL savings on top of existing (seeded) contributions. 

**Design Intent**:
- Seeds = What user is ALREADY contributing
- Allocation % = ADDITIONAL savings they want to add
- Total = Seeds + Additional

**User Expectation Mismatch**:
Most users likely expect allocation % to mean TOTAL desired savings rate, not additional.

### ‚úÖ Profile 5: Bracket Strategist (PASSED)
**Test Date**: August 27, 2025

**Scenario Tested**:
- Age 35, W-2 Employee, $95k income
- 20% allocation requested
- Has employer 401(k) with 100% match up to 4%

**Results**:
- Expected: $1,300/mo
- Actual: $1,300/mo
- Status: ‚úÖ Perfect match!

**Working Features**:
- ‚úÖ Employer match correctly calculated ($317/mo)
- ‚úÖ Traditional 401(k) contributions
- ‚úÖ HSA allocation working
- ‚úÖ Health Bank as overflow
- ‚úÖ No seeding issues

**Key Insight**: Profile 5 does NOT seed the employer match - it adds match as a vehicle in the order, allowing the allocation engine to fill it. This is the correct approach.

---

- Near retirement (5 years)

**Results**:
- Expected: $4,200/mo
- Actual: $4,200/mo
- Status: ‚úÖ Perfect match!

**Working Features**:
- ‚úÖ Catch-up contributions
- ‚úÖ Appropriate vehicle prioritization for late stage

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Design Decision Required: Allocation Percentage Meaning
**Current Design**: Allocation % = ADDITIONAL savings on top of existing (seeded) contributions

**User Expectation**: Allocation % = TOTAL desired savings rate

**Options**:
a) **Keep Current Design** - Document clearly that % is additional
   - Pros: Preserves original design intent
   - Cons: Confusing for users

b) **Change to Total %** - Make allocation % represent total desired rate
   - Pros: Matches user expectations
   - Cons: Requires reworking computeNetPool logic

c) **Add Toggle** - Let user choose "additional" vs "total" percentage
   - Pros: Flexible for different use cases
   - Cons: Adds complexity

**Recommended**: Option B - Users naturally think in terms of total savings rate

**Why This Matters**:
- Profile 1 user with $50k annual profit distributions asking for 30% allocation gets $6,866/mo instead of $2,700/mo
- Profile 3 user with $48k annual Solo 401k asking for 25% allocation gets $6,042/mo instead of $2,000/mo
- Profile 8 user with $100k annual 401k asking for 25% allocation gets $15,832/mo instead of $7,500/mo

This could lead to users being advised to save FAR more than they intended or can afford.

### 2. Fix Profile 4 Test Data
**Problem**: Test uses ex_q5/6 instead of ex_q1/2

**Solution**: Update test data to use correct field mappings

### 3. Document Seeding Best Practices
Create clear guidelines for when to use seeds vs vehicle orders:
- **Seeds**: Automatic contributions (employer match, RMDs)
- **Vehicle Orders**: All user-specified contributions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Fix Profile 1, 3, 8 seeding logic in Code.js
2. Fix Profile 4 test data mapping
3. Re-run tests for affected profiles
4. Update documentation with seeding best practices

### Testing Improvements:
1. Add validation to catch seeding misuse
2. Create unit tests for computeNetPool function
3. Add comprehensive test scenarios for edge cases

### Medium Priority:
4. **Profile 5 (Bracket Strategist)** - Test Traditional vs Roth preference
5. **Profile 6 (Catch-Up)** - Test age 50+ catch-up contributions
6. **Profile 9 (Late Stage)** - Test Roth conversions and QCD planning

### To Fix:
1. **Profile 4 Test Data**: Update ex_q field mappings
   - Change ex_q5 ‚Üí ex_q1 (Traditional IRA balance)
   - Change ex_q6 ‚Üí ex_q2 (401k accepts rollovers)
   - Add ex_q3-6 for employer 401k questions
