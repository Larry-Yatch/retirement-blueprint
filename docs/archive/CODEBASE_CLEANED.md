# Codebase Cleanup Complete

## Local Directory Status ✅
The following files remain (only essential files):
- **Code.js** - Main application code with all 9 profile helpers
- **Testing.js** - Basic testing framework
- **Testing_Scenarios.js** - Comprehensive test scenarios for all profiles
- **Form_Management.js** - Form creation and management utilities
- **Current_Forms_Full.js** - Current form definitions
- **Fix_Missing_Headers.js** - Utility to fix missing spreadsheet headers

## Google Apps Script Cleanup Required
Since clasp doesn't automatically delete files from Google Apps Script, you need to:
1. Open your Google Sheets
2. Go to Extensions → Apps Script
3. Delete these test files manually:
   - Quick_Test_Profile4.js
   - Test_HeaderMapping.js
   - Test_Profile4_Direct.js
   - Test_Profile8_*.js (4 files)
   - Testing_Enhanced.js

## Future Pushes
The `.claspignore` file has been updated to only push essential files:
- Core functionality (Code.js)
- Testing framework (Testing.js, Testing_Scenarios.js)
- Form management (Form_Management.js, Current_Forms_Full.js)
- Utilities (Fix_Missing_Headers.js)

All temporary test files will be excluded from future pushes.
