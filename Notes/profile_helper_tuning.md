# Profile Helper Tuning - Master Document

## üéØ Purpose
This document serves as the single source of truth for the profile helper tuning process, tracking what we've accomplished, current status, and next steps for each profile.

## üîß Infrastructure Improvements Completed

### 1. Universal Functions Implementation (‚úÖ Complete)
All profiles now properly use:
- `calculateHsaMonthlyCapacity()` - HSA limits with age 55+ catch-up
- `calculateCesaMonthlyCapacity()` - CESA limits per child
- `applyRothIRAPhaseOut()` - Income-based Roth IRA phase-out
- `prioritizeTraditionalAccounts()` / `prioritizeRothAccounts()` - Tax preference ordering

### 2. Employer 401(k) Expansion (‚úÖ Complete)
- Extended `addEmployer401kVehicles()` to 6 profiles (was only Profile 7)
- Added to profiles: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 (in addition to existing Profile 7)
- Ensures "free money" employer match is never missed

### 3. Form Question Mapping System (‚úÖ Complete)
Implemented flexible mapping system to handle dynamic form questions:

#### Key Components Added to Code.js:
1. **FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING** (lines 1776-1818)
   - Maps form question positions to ex_q1-10 slots
   - Profile-specific configurations
   - Easy to update when forms change

2. **remapFormValues()** (lines 1823-1844)
   - Intelligently remaps responses during paste to Working Sheet
   - Ensures employer 401(k) questions always land in ex_q1-4

3. **Updated handlePhase2()** (lines 2226-2237)
   - Automatically applies mapping based on profile
   - Seamless handling of both mapped and unmapped profiles

4. **testFormMapping()** (lines 1849-1870)
   - Utility function to verify mappings

#### Current Mapping Configuration:
```javascript
FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING = {
  '2_ROBS_Curious': {
    9: 'ex_q1',   // employer 401k
    10: 'ex_q2',  // employer match
    11: 'ex_q3',  // match percentage
    12: 'ex_q4',  // roth option
    7: 'ex_q5',   // rollover balance (original)
    8: 'ex_q6'    // annual contribution (original)
  },
  // Similar mappings for profiles 4, 5, 6, 9
}
```

## üìù Phase 2 Form Updates

### Employer 401(k) Questions Added
‚úÖ All forms for profiles 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 now include:
1. Does your employer offer a 401(k) retirement plan?
2. Does your employer match your 401(k) contributions?
3. What percentage does your employer match?
4. Does your employer 401(k) plan have a Roth option?

### Form Update Process
When tuning profiles and changing questions:
1. Add/modify questions in Google Form
2. Note new positions (count from 1, including timestamp)
3. Update FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING in Code.js
4. Test with dummy submission

## üöÄ Next Steps for Profile Tuning

### Current Status (Testing Phase):
üîß **Infrastructure:** Complete  
üß™ **Testing:** In Progress  
üìù **Test Functions Added:**
- `testEmployer401kIntegration()` - Verifies employer match vehicles are created
- `testFormQuestionMapping()` - Tests form question remapping logic

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Test Employer 401(k) Integration** ‚è≥ - Run test functions in Apps Script
2. **Verify Question Mapping** ‚è≥ - Submit test forms for profiles 2,4,5,6,9
3. **Begin Profile 2 Tuning** üîú - First profile with new employer logic

### Tuning Process for Each Profile:
1. Review current vehicle order and logic
2. Test with various scenarios (income levels, ages, preferences)
3. Adjust vehicle priorities based on results
4. Update extra questions as needed
5. Document changes in this file

### Key Questions for Each Profile:
- Are vehicles in optimal order?
- Do contribution limits calculate correctly?
- Does tax preference logic work as expected?
- Are there missing vehicles or strategies?
- Do the extra questions gather needed information?

## üìã Testing Checklist

For each profile being tuned:
- [ ] Submit test Phase 2 form
- [ ] Verify question mapping works
- [ ] Check employer match vehicle appears (if applicable)
- [ ] Test with minimum allocation scenario
- [ ] Test with maximum allocation scenario
- [ ] Test with different tax preferences
- [ ] Test with catch-up eligibility (age 50+)
- [ ] Verify results align with profile strategy
