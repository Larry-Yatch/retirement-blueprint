# Profile 1: ROBS In Use

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Business owners who have already implemented a ROBS (Rollover as Business Startup) structure with an active C-corporation and are using their retirement funds to operate their business.

### Core Challenge
Maximizing retirement contributions through their C-corp's 401(k) plan while maintaining ROBS compliance and leveraging unlimited profit distributions as retirement contributions.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike all other profiles, Profile 1 users have unlimited contribution potential through C-corp profit distributions into their ROBS Solo 401(k), making this the highest contribution capacity profile.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
1 (First in classification hierarchy - highest priority)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (isUsingROBS === 'Yes') {
    return '1_ROBS_In_Use';
}
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Franchise Owner**: Used ROBS to buy franchise, now operating
- **Business Purchaser**: Acquired existing business with ROBS funds
- **Startup Founder**: Launched new business with retirement rollover
- **Growth Phase**: Profitable C-corp ready to maximize contributions

## üöÄ Implementation Status

### Current State

}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Current questions are open-ended, need structured inputs
- Missing profit distribution amount question
- No compliance validation questions

## üéØ Vehicle Priority Order

### Education Domain

#### Base Order
1. **Combined CESA** - $167/child/month
   - Why: Tax-free education savings
   - Conditions: Only if has children

2. **Education Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for education
   - Conditions: Always included

### Health Domain

#### Base Order
1. **HSA** - Individual: $358/mo, Family: $713/mo
   - Why: Triple tax advantage
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Catch-up: +$83/mo if age 55+

2. **Health Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for health
   - Conditions: Always included

### Retirement Domain

#### Base Order
1. **ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution** - UNLIMITED
   - Why: C-corp profit distributions have no statutory limit
   - Conditions: Primary retirement vehicle
   - Note: Highest priority for maximizing retirement savings

2. **ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Roth** - $1,958/mo
   - Why: Tax-free growth option
   - Conditions: If tax preference includes Roth
   - Catch-up (50+): $2,583/mo
   - Catch-up (60+): $2,896/mo

   - Conditions: Always included

### Dynamic Modifications

#### Tax Preference Impact
- **"Now"**: Traditional 401(k) prioritized over Roth 401(k)
- **"Later"**: Roth 401(k) prioritized over Traditional 401(k)
- **"Both"**: Maintains balanced order shown above

#### If High Income
- Roth IRA converts to Backdoor Roth IRA
- No impact on ROBS Solo 401(k) vehicles

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **No Profit Input**: Can't specify available profit distributions
2. **Open-ended Questions**: Current form questions too vague
3. **Reasonable Compensation**: No C-corp salary optimization
4. **Spouse Coordination**: No questions about spouse in business

### Future Enhancements
1. **Profit Distribution Calculator**: Optimize employee vs profit sharing split
2. **Compliance Dashboard**: ROBS rule compliance checks
3. **Multi-Entity Support**: Handle multiple businesses
4. **Exit Planning**: Strategy for ROBS termination
5. **Spouse Optimization**: Double capacity with spouse participation

### Tuning Checklist
- [ ] Convert open-ended questions to structured inputs
- [ ] Add profit distribution amount field
- [ ] Implement profit vehicle with proper capacity
- [ ] Test unlimited contribution handling
- [ ] Add reasonable compensation validation
- [ ] Test tax preference ordering
- [ ] Verify catch-up calculations
- [ ] Document C-corp requirements

## üìä Common Calculations

### ROBS Solo 401(k) Structure
```
Employee Deferral: $23,500/year ($1,958/mo)
With Catch-up (50+): $31,000/year ($2,583/mo)
With Catch-up (60+): $34,750/year ($2,896/mo)

Profit Sharing Component: 
- Up to 25% of W-2 compensation
- Plus unlimited C-corp profit distributions
- Total: No statutory limit on profit distributions
```

### Reasonable Compensation Example
```
C-Corp Revenue: $500,000
Reasonable Salary: $100,000
Payroll Taxes: ~$15,300
Net for Profit Distribution: $384,700
All can go to ROBS Solo 401(k)
```

### Monthly Breakdown Example
```
Salary: $100,000/year = $8,333/mo
Employee Deferral: $1,958/mo
Profit Distribution: $32,058/mo (using above example)
Total to ROBS: $34,016/mo
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **ROBS vehicles missing**: Check isUsingROBS = 'Yes'
2. **No profit vehicle**: Current implementation missing
3. **Limited contributions**: Need profit distribution input
4. **Wrong tax order**: Verify Tax_Minimization preference

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('1_ROBS_In_Use')
showVehicleOrder('1_ROBS_In_Use')
traceAllocation('1_ROBS_In_Use')
```
