# Profile 1: ROBS In Use

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Business owners who have already implemented a ROBS (Rollover as Business Startup) structure with an active C-corporation and are using their retirement funds to operate their business.

### Core Challenge
Maximizing retirement contributions through their C-corp's 401(k) plan while maintaining ROBS compliance and leveraging unlimited profit distributions as retirement contributions.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike all other profiles, Profile 1 users have unlimited contribution potential through C-corp profit distributions into their ROBS Solo 401(k), making this the highest contribution capacity profile.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
1 (First in classification hierarchy - highest priority)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (isUsingROBS === 'Yes') {
    return '1_ROBS_In_Use';
}
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Franchise Owner**: Used ROBS to buy franchise, now operating
- **Business Purchaser**: Acquired existing business with ROBS funds
- **Startup Founder**: Launched new business with retirement rollover
- **Growth Phase**: Profitable C-corp ready to maximize contributions

## üöÄ Implementation Status

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Profile Helper Function
- ‚úÖ Universal Functions Integration
- ‚úÖ Form Questions Added
- ‚úÖ Form Mapping Configured
- ‚úÖ Profit Distribution Logic Implemented
- ‚úÖ Test Scenarios Written
- ‚úÖ Live Form Testing
- ‚úÖ Production Ready

### Status Summary
**Status**: Fully Tested and Production Ready
**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Next Steps**: Monitor production usage and gather feedback

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Profile Helper Location
`Code.js` line 1016

### Key Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ ROBS Solo 401(k) vehicle included
- ‚úÖ Catch-up contributions (50+)
- ‚úÖ Income phase-out handling
- ‚úÖ Tax preference ordering
- ‚úÖ Profit distribution optimization
- ‚úÖ Dynamic contribution type filtering (Roth/Traditional/Both)
- ‚úÖ HSA prioritization (moved up to position 3)
- ‚úÖ Profit distribution seeding from ex_q6

### Universal Functions Used
```javascript
‚úÖ calculateHsaMonthlyCapacity()
‚úÖ calculateCesaMonthlyCapacity()
‚ùå addEmployer401kVehicles() // Not applicable - has ROBS
‚úÖ applyRothIRAPhaseOut()
‚úÖ prioritizeTraditionalAccounts() / prioritizeRothAccounts()
```

## üìù Form Configuration

### Phase 2 Extra Questions
1. **ex_q1**: Describe how your ROBS strategy is currently structured
2. **ex_q2**: How are your business profits routed into your Solo 401(k)?
3. **ex_q3**: Which type of contributions are you making? (Roth/Traditional/Both)
4. **ex_q4**: How often do you contribute? (Monthly/Quarterly)
5. **ex_q5**: Do you also contribute to a Roth IRA? Amount?
6. **ex_q6**: Expected annual business distribution to Solo 401(k)?

### Form Mapping (FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING)
```javascript
// Form questions map directly to ex_q fields, no remapping needed
'1_ROBS_In_Use': {
    // Direct mapping - form positions match ex_q numbers
}
```

### Implementation Logic
The profile now reads all ROBS-specific information:
- **ex_q1**: ROBS structure description (informational)
- **ex_q2**: Profit routing method (informational)
- **ex_q3**: Contribution type preference (Roth/Traditional/Both)
- **ex_q4**: Contribution frequency (informational)
- **ex_q5**: Roth IRA participation (Yes/No)
- **ex_q6**: Annual profit distribution amount (key input for seeding)

## üéØ Vehicle Priority Order

### Education Domain

#### Base Order
1. **Combined CESA** - $167/child/month
   - Why: Tax-free education savings
   - Conditions: Only if has children

2. **Education Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for education
   - Conditions: Always included

### Health Domain

#### Base Order
1. **HSA** - Individual: $358/mo, Family: $713/mo
   - Why: Triple tax advantage
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Catch-up: +$83/mo if age 55+

2. **Health Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for health
   - Conditions: Always included

### Retirement Domain

#### Base Order
1. **ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Roth** - $1,958/mo
   - Why: Tax-free growth option
   - Conditions: If tax preference includes Roth
   - Catch-up (50+): $2,583/mo
   - Catch-up (60+): $2,896/mo

2. **HSA** - (retirement portion)
   - Why: Triple tax advantage - deduction, growth, and withdrawal
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Note: Moved up due to superior tax treatment

3. **ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Traditional** - $1,958/mo
   - Why: Current tax deduction
   - Conditions: If tax preference includes Traditional
   - Catch-up (50+): $2,583/mo
   - Catch-up (60+): $2,896/mo

4. **Roth IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: Additional tax-free growth outside ROBS
   - Conditions: Subject to income phase-out

5. **Family Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Final overflow
   - Conditions: Always included

#### Non-Discretionary Contributions
**ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution** - UNLIMITED
- **Not in cascade**: This is a non-discretionary contribution from C-corp profits
- **Equal in actual/ideal**: Since it's funded by business profits, not personal savings
- **Seeded amount**: Based on annual profit distribution (ex_q6) divided by 12
- **Note**: Does not participate in the waterfall allocation; amount is fixed

### Dynamic Modifications

#### Tax Preference Impact
- **"Now"**: Traditional 401(k) prioritized over Roth 401(k)
- **"Later"**: Roth 401(k) prioritized over Traditional 401(k)
- **"Both"**: Maintains balanced order shown above

#### If High Income
- Roth IRA converts to Backdoor Roth IRA
- No impact on ROBS Solo 401(k) vehicles

### Final Order Examples

#### Scenario: Profitable C-corp, Tax Preference "Later"
**Education Domain:**
1. Combined CESA - $333/mo (2 kids)
2. Education Bank - Unlimited

**Health Domain:**
1. HSA - $713/mo (family)
2. Health Bank - Unlimited

**Retirement Domain (Cascade Order):**
1. ROBS Solo 401(k) Roth - $1,958/mo
2. HSA - $713/mo (retirement portion)
3. ROBS Solo 401(k) Traditional - $1,958/mo
4. Roth IRA - $583/mo
5. Family Bank - Unlimited

**Non-Discretionary (Fixed Amount):**
- ROBS Solo 401(k) Profit - Seeded from business profits (not in cascade)

### Test Commands
```javascript
// Test functions created and passing:
testProfile1Basic()        // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile1HighProfit()   // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile1TaxPreferences() // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile1All()          // ‚úÖ PASSED
```

### Bugs Found and Fixed
1. **HSA Priority Issue**: HSA was too low in vehicle order
   - Fix: Moved HSA to position 3 after profit distribution and employee contributions
   
2. **Contribution Type Filtering**: ex_q3 wasn't properly filtering vehicles
   - Fix: Added logic to filter Traditional/Roth based on user preference
   
3. **Profit Distribution Seeding**: Annual amount wasn't converting to monthly
   - Fix: Added division by 12 when seeding profit distribution

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **No Profit Input**: Can't specify available profit distributions
2. **Open-ended Questions**: Current form questions too vague
3. **Reasonable Compensation**: No C-corp salary optimization
4. **Spouse Coordination**: No questions about spouse in business

### Future Enhancements
1. **Profit Distribution Calculator**: Optimize employee vs profit sharing split
2. **Compliance Dashboard**: ROBS rule compliance checks
3. **Multi-Entity Support**: Handle multiple businesses
4. **Exit Planning**: Strategy for ROBS termination
5. **Spouse Optimization**: Double capacity with spouse participation

### Tuning Checklist
- [ ] Convert open-ended questions to structured inputs
- [ ] Add profit distribution amount field
- [ ] Implement profit vehicle with proper capacity
- [ ] Test unlimited contribution handling
- [ ] Add reasonable compensation validation
- [ ] Test tax preference ordering
- [ ] Verify catch-up calculations
- [ ] Document C-corp requirements

## üîß Implementation Updates

### January 2025 Updates
1. **ROBS Profit Distribution Handling**:
   - Removed from cascade vehicle order in retirement domain
   - Now treated as a non-discretionary contribution
   - Actual and ideal allocations always equal the seeded amount
   - Prevents discretionary savings from being allocated to profit distribution

### December 2024 Implementation Updates

### Key Changes Made
1. **Profit Distribution Logic**: 
   - Reads annual profit distribution from ex_q6
   - Seeds the amount into 'ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution'
   - Maintains infinite capacity for this vehicle

2. **Contribution Type Filtering**:
   - Reads preference from ex_q3 (Roth only/Traditional only/Both)
   - Dynamically filters vehicles based on preference
   - Preserves profit distribution regardless of preference

3. **Roth IRA Handling**:
   - Reads participation status from ex_q5
   - Removes Roth IRA from order if user indicates no participation
   - Still applies phase-out rules when included

4. **HSA Prioritization**:
   - Moved HSA to position 3 (after profit distribution and employee contributions)
   - Recognizes HSA's superior tax treatment for retirement savings

5. **Enhanced Vehicle Capacity Calculations**:
   - Proper catch-up contributions for 401(k) based on age
   - Age 50-59: +$7,500/year
   - Age 60+: +$11,250/year
   - IRA catch-up: +$1,000/year for 50+

### Implementation Highlights
```javascript
// Profit distribution seeding
if (annualProfitDistribution > 0) {
  seeds.Retirement['ROBS Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Profit Distribution'] = annualProfitDistribution / 12;
}

// Contribution type filtering
if (contributionType === 'Roth only') {
  baseRetirementOrder = baseRetirementOrder.filter(v => 
    !v.name.includes('Traditional') || v.name.includes('Profit Distribution')
  );
}

// HSA repositioning
const hsaIndex = baseRetirementOrder.findIndex(v => v.name === 'HSA');
if (hsaIndex > 3) {
  const hsaVehicle = baseRetirementOrder.splice(hsaIndex, 1)[0];
  baseRetirementOrder.splice(3, 0, hsaVehicle);
}
```

## üìä Common Calculations

### ROBS Solo 401(k) Structure
```
Employee Deferral: $23,500/year ($1,958/mo)
With Catch-up (50+): $31,000/year ($2,583/mo)
With Catch-up (60+): $34,750/year ($2,896/mo)

Profit Sharing Component: 
- Up to 25% of W-2 compensation
- Plus unlimited C-corp profit distributions
- Total: No statutory limit on profit distributions
```

### Reasonable Compensation Example
```
C-Corp Revenue: $500,000
Reasonable Salary: $100,000
Payroll Taxes: ~$15,300
Net for Profit Distribution: $384,700
All can go to ROBS Solo 401(k)
```

### Monthly Breakdown Example
```
Salary: $100,000/year = $8,333/mo
Employee Deferral: $1,958/mo
Profit Distribution: $32,058/mo (using above example)
Total to ROBS: $34,016/mo
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **ROBS vehicles missing**: Check isUsingROBS = 'Yes'
2. **No profit vehicle**: Current implementation missing
3. **Limited contributions**: Need profit distribution input
4. **Wrong tax order**: Verify Tax_Minimization preference

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('1_ROBS_In_Use')
showVehicleOrder('1_ROBS_In_Use')
traceAllocation('1_ROBS_In_Use')
```
