# Profile 2: ROBS Curious - Technical Review Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

### 1. **Dynamic Vehicle Selection**
- Correctly identifies employment type and provides appropriate vehicles
- W-2 employees get employer 401(k) options
- Self-employed get Solo 401(k) options
- "Both" employment gets both sets of vehicles

### 2. **Tax Preference Logic**
- Properly orders vehicles based on tax minimization preference:
  - "Now": Traditional accounts first
  - "Later": Roth accounts first
  - "Both": Balanced approach

### 3. **Universal Functions**
- HSA capacity correctly calculated based on filing status (individual vs family)
- CESA capacity properly scales with number of children
- Age-based catch-up contributions work for 50+ and 60+

### 4. **Phase-Out Logic**
- Roth IRA phase-out correctly applied based on income
- Backdoor Roth appears when direct contributions phased out
- Handles different filing statuses appropriately

### 5. **ROBS Planning Support**
- Traditional IRA included for future ROBS rollovers
- Captures planned rollover amount in seeds
- Supports transition scenarios

## üîß Fixed Issues

### 1. **Solo 401(k) Employer Calculation** ‚úÖ
**Previous Issue**: Used incorrect percentage for self-employed individuals
**Fix Applied**: Now uses conservative 20% for all self-employed (accounts for SE tax)
**Note**: This is conservative - C-Corps can contribute 25%, but we need entity type to be precise
**Future Enhancement**: Add business entity type question for accurate calculations

### 2. **Static Configuration Clarification** ‚úÖ
**Previous Issue**: Static vehicle order didn't match dynamic implementation
**Fix Applied**: Added comment indicating dynamic generation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Considerations

### 1. **ROBS-Specific Gaps**
- No timeline question (when planning to execute ROBS)
- No entity type verification (ROBS requires C-corp)
- No existing retirement balance question
- No risk tolerance assessment for high-risk ROBS strategy

### 2. **Edge Cases**
- Married filing separately has very restrictive limits (handled but not optimized)
- Multiple businesses not addressed (Solo 401(k) aggregation rules)
- State tax considerations not included

### 3. **Educational Opportunities**
- Could add notes explaining ROBS requirements
- No guidance on C-corp formation process
- Missing warnings about ROBS risks and compliance

## üí° Recommendations for Live Testing

### 1. **Test Scenarios to Run**
- W-2 employee transitioning to self-employment
- High-income self-employed with catch-up eligibility
- Mixed employment with both 401(k) types
- Low income to verify phase-outs work correctly

### 2. **High Priority Questions to Add**
- **"What type of business entity?"** - Critical for accurate Solo 401(k) calculations
  - Sole Proprietorship ‚Üí 20% employer contribution limit
  - S-Corp ‚Üí 25% of W-2 wages
  - C-Corp ‚Üí 25% of W-2 wages (required for ROBS)
- "When do you plan to implement ROBS?" (affects urgency)
- "Current retirement account balance?" (affects ROBS feasibility)

### 3. **Monitor During Testing**
- Verify employer contribution calculations are reasonable
- Check that vehicle ordering makes sense for user's situation
- Ensure Traditional IRA is being utilized for ROBS planning

## üéØ Overall Assessment

**Profile 2 (ROBS Curious) is production-ready** with the fixes applied. The implementation:
- ‚úÖ Handles all major employment scenarios
- ‚úÖ Correctly calculates contribution limits
- ‚úÖ Provides appropriate vehicle recommendations
- ‚úÖ Supports ROBS planning needs

The remaining gaps are mostly around ROBS-specific education and edge cases that can be addressed in future iterations based on user feedback.
