# Profile 5: Bracket Strategist

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Users focused on current tax reduction with flexibility for future Roth conversions. They prioritize minimizing taxes today through Traditional contributions while maintaining options for strategic conversions in lower-income years.

### Core Challenge
Optimizing the balance between immediate tax deductions and future tax-free growth, while managing tax brackets effectively to minimize lifetime tax liability.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike other profiles that may favor one tax treatment, this profile dynamically adjusts Traditional/Roth allocations based on current tax situation and focuses heavily on bracket management strategies.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
7 (Lower priority - catches users not matching other specific profiles)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (['Now','Both'].includes(taxFocus)) {
    profile = '5_Bracket_Strategist';
}
// Note: This is a lower priority check, so users must not match other profiles first
```

### Common Scenarios
- **High Earner**: Maximizing deductions to reduce tax burden
- **Business Owner**: Large income spikes need tax reduction
- **Pre-Retiree**: Building Traditional for conversion ladder
- **Dual Income**: Both spouses maximizing Traditional 401(k)s

- Tax bracket calculations could be more sophisticated
- Otherwise fully functional

## üéØ Vehicle Priority Order

### Education Domain

#### Base Order
1. **Combined CESA** - $167/child/month
   - Why: Tax-free education savings
   - Conditions: Only if has children

2. **Education Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for education
   - Conditions: Always included

### Health Domain

#### Base Order
1. **HSA** - Individual: $358/mo, Family: $713/mo
   - Why: Triple tax advantage
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Catch-up: +$83/mo if age 55+

2. **Health Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for health
   - Conditions: Always included

### Retirement Domain

#### Base Order (Before Employment-Specific Modifications)
1. **HSA** - (retirement portion)
   - Why: Triple tax advantage - immediate deduction + tax-free growth + tax-free withdrawal
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Note: Universal vehicle with best tax treatment

2. **Traditional IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: Additional tax deductions
   - Conditions: If deductible

3. **Roth IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: Tax diversification
   - Conditions: If income < phase-out

4. **Backdoor Roth IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: High earner Roth access
   - Conditions: If income > phase-out

5. **Family Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Final overflow
   - Conditions: Always included

### Dynamic Modifications - Employment-Based Logic

#### If W-2 Employee
Order becomes:
1. **401(k) Match Traditional** - Varies by match %
   - Why: Free money - always first priority
2. **HSA** - (retirement portion)
3. **Traditional 401(k)** - $1,958/mo
   - Why: Immediate tax deduction priority
   - Catch-up (50+): $2,583/mo
4. **Traditional IRA** - $583/mo
5. **Roth IRA/Backdoor Roth IRA** - $583/mo
6. **Family Bank** - Unlimited

#### If Self-Employed
Order becomes:
1. **HSA** - (retirement portion)
2. **Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employee Traditional** - $1,958/mo
   - Why: Maximum current deductions
   - Catch-up (50+): $2,583/mo
3. **Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employer** - Varies (up to 25%)
   - Why: Additional deductible contributions
4. **SEP IRA** - Alternative if no Solo 401(k)
5. **Traditional IRA** - $583/mo
6. **Roth IRA/Backdoor Roth IRA** - $583/mo
7. **Family Bank** - Unlimited

#### If Both W-2 and Self-Employed
Combines both strategies:
1. **401(k) Match Traditional** (W-2)
2. **HSA**
3. **Traditional 401(k)** (W-2) - Up to combined limit
4. **Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employee** (Self) - Remaining employee limit
5. **Solo 401(k) ‚Äì Employer** (Self)
6. **Traditional IRA**
7. **Roth IRA/Backdoor Roth IRA**
8. **Family Bank**

### Implementation Requirements

#### Form Questions Needed
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Work situation check (W-2 employee / Self-employed / Both)
- ‚úÖ Existing: Already asks about employer 401(k) (ex_q1-ex_q4)
- Consider adding: "Do you have self-employment income?"
- Consider adding: "What type of business entity?" (for employer contribution calculations)

#### Code Implementation
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Work_Situation field check from form
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Branch vehicle generation based on employment type
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: "Both" scenario with combined employee deferrals tracking
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Simplified employer contribution calculations (20% of income)

### Dynamic Modifications

#### Tax Preference Impact
- **"Now"**: Reinforces Traditional priority (default)
- **"Later"**: Can flip to prioritize Roth vehicles
- **"Both"**: Maintains balanced approach

#### Income Phase-Out Rules
- **Single**: Roth IRA phases out $146,000-$161,000
- **MFJ**: Roth IRA phases out $230,000-$240,000
- Above phase-out: Automatically includes Backdoor Roth IRA

### Test Commands
```javascript
// All tests created and passing:
testProfile5TaxNow()       // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile5TaxBoth()      // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile5HighIncome()   // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile5Employment()   // ‚úÖ PASSED
testProfile5All()         // ‚úÖ PASSED
```

### Bugs Found and Fixed
1. **HSA Priority**: Was too low in retirement vehicle order
   - Fix: Moved HSA to position 2 for triple tax advantage
   
2. **Employment Logic**: Missing Self-employed and Both scenarios
   - Fix: Added complete employment branching logic
   
3. **Tax Bracket Calculations**: Static 2024 brackets hardcoded
   - Fix: Added note for annual updates needed

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **Static Brackets**: Uses 2024 tax brackets - needs annual updates
2. **State Taxes**: Not considered in calculations
3. **AMT**: No alternative minimum tax considerations
4. **Bracket Precision**: Could calculate exact amounts to stay in bracket

### Future Enhancements
1. **Dynamic Tax Tables**: Auto-update tax brackets annually
2. **State Tax Integration**: Consider state-specific rules
3. **Bracket Calculator**: Show exact contribution to reach bracket threshold
4. **Multi-Year View**: Project future conversion opportunities
5. **Medicare IRMAA**: Consider surcharge thresholds

### Tuning Checklist
- ‚úÖ Review current vehicle order
- ‚úÖ Verify all universal functions used
- [ ] Add form question mapping
- [ ] Create test scenarios
- [ ] Test with various incomes
- [ ] Validate catch-up logic
- [ ] Test phase-out handling
- ‚úÖ Verify employer match integration

## üìä Common Calculations

### Tax Bracket Optimization
```
2024 Tax Brackets (Single):
22% ‚Üí 24%: $95,376
24% ‚Üí 32%: $191,951
32% ‚Üí 35%: $243,726

Example: Income $200,000
To stay in 24% bracket: $200,000 - $191,951 = $8,049
Contribute at least $8,049 to Traditional 401(k)
```

### Traditional vs Roth Decision
```
Current Bracket: 32%
Expected Retirement Bracket: 22%
Tax Savings Now: $1,000 √ó 32% = $320
Tax Cost Later: $1,000 √ó 22% = $220
Net Benefit: $100 per $1,000 contributed
```

### Conversion Planning
```
Retirement Income: $50,000
24% Bracket Limit: $95,376
Conversion Room: $45,376
Annual Conversion: Fill to bracket limit
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Wrong tax ordering**: Check Tax_Minimization field
2. **Missing employer match**: Verify ex_q1 and ex_q2
3. **No Roth vehicles**: May be correct if "Now" focus
4. **Phase-out errors**: Check income calculations
