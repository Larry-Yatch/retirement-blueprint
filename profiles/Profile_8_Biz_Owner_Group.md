# Profile 8: Biz Owner Group

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Business owners who have W-2 employees and are seeking advanced retirement strategies beyond individual limits. They can establish group plans and potentially use defined benefit plans for significantly higher contribution limits.

### Core Challenge
Maximizing owner retirement benefits while managing employee plan costs, complying with nondiscrimination rules, and leveraging advanced strategies like defined benefit plans for massive tax deductions.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike Solo 401(k) builders, these owners must cover employees but gain access to defined benefit plans that can allow $200,000-$280,000+ annual contributions for older, high-income owners.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
3 (High priority - after ROBS profiles but before individual profiles)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (hasEmployees === 'Yes') {
    return '8_Biz_Owner_Group';
}
// Note: Takes precedence over Solo 401(k) Builder and other profiles
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Professional Practice**: Doctors, lawyers with staff
- **Established Business**: 10+ years, stable profits
- **Family Business**: Employing family members strategically
- **Multiple Entities**: Different plans for different businesses

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **No Employee Analysis**: Can't optimize plan design
2. **Static DB Amount**: Not calculated based on age/income
3. **No Safe Harbor Logic**: Missing automatic safe harbor
4. **No Multi-Entity**: Can't handle multiple businesses

### Future Enhancements
1. **Plan Design Optimizer**: Calculate optimal 401(k) formula
2. **DB/DC Combo**: Optimize combination plans
3. **Employee Demographics**: Tailor to workforce
4. **Cash Balance Plans**: Modern DB alternative
5. **NQDC Options**: For amounts above qualified limits

### Tuning Checklist
- [ ] Add employee demographic questions
- [ ] Create DB contribution calculator
- [ ] Add safe harbor decision logic
- [ ] Test with various business types
- [ ] Add profit sharing formulas
- [ ] Include vesting strategies
- [ ] Test nondiscrimination rules
- [ ] Add family employee optimization

## üìä Common Calculations

### Defined Benefit Maximum
```
Age 55, Retire at 62:
Maximum annual benefit: $280,000
Years to retirement: 7
Required annual contribution: ~$250,000
Tax deduction at 37%: $92,500 saved
```

### Safe Harbor 401(k) Cost
```
Payroll: $500,000 (5 employees @ $100k avg)
3% Non-elective: $15,000 annual cost
Benefit: No testing, owner can max out
Owner contribution: $31,000 (age 50+)
ROI: $31,000 benefit for $15,000 cost
```

### Profit Sharing Allocation
```
Total Payroll: $600,000
Owner Salary: $200,000 (33%)
Profit Sharing: $150,000 available

Age-weighted formula:
- Owner (age 55): $100,000 (67%)
- Employees: $50,000 (33%)
Passes nondiscrimination testing
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No DB plan shown**: Check age and income thresholds
2. **Group 401(k) missing**: Verify hasEmployees = "Yes"
3. **Wrong contribution limits**: Check age for catch-up
4. **Phase-out issues**: Most should show backdoor Roth

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('8_Biz_Owner_Group')
showVehicleOrder('8_Biz_Owner_Group')
traceAllocation('8_Biz_Owner_Group')
calculateDBContribution(age, income)
```
