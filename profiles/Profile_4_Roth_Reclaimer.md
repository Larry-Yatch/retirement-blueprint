# Profile 4: Roth Reclaimer

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Individuals with existing Traditional IRA balances who want to optimize Roth conversions and navigate the complexities of backdoor Roth strategies, including those affected by the pro-rata rule.

### Core Challenge
Managing existing pre-tax IRA balances that complicate backdoor Roth conversions due to the pro-rata rule, while maximizing tax-efficient retirement savings through available Roth strategies.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
5 (After self-employed but before age-based profiles)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (hasTraditionalIRA === 'Yes' && !isUsingROBS && !isSelfEmployed) {
    return '4_Roth_Reclaimer';
}
```

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **Pro-Rata Calculator**: No automated calculation shown
2. **Conversion Tax Impact**: No tax estimation provided
3. **Multi-Year Planning**: No conversion ladder optimization
4. **State Tax**: Not considered in conversion timing

### Future Enhancements
1. **Pro-Rata Calculator**: Show impact of IRA balance
2. **Tax Optimizer**: Estimate conversion tax costs
3. **Conversion Planner**: Multi-year ladder strategy
4. **Roll-In Strategy**: 401(k) roll-in to clear IRA
5. **State Migration**: Timing for state tax savings

### Tuning Checklist
- ‚úÖ Review current vehicle order
- ‚úÖ Verify all universal functions used
- ‚úÖ Check form question mapping
- ‚úÖ Test with edge cases
- ‚úÖ Validate catch-up logic
- ‚úÖ Confirm phase-out handling
- ‚úÖ Test employer benefits integration
- ‚úÖ Verify tax preference ordering

## üìä Common Calculations

### Pro-Rata Rule Example
```
Traditional IRA Balance: $95,000
Basis (after-tax): $5,000
Conversion Amount: $10,000

Taxable Portion: $10,000 √ó ($95,000/$100,000) = $9,500
Tax-Free Portion: $10,000 √ó ($5,000/$100,000) = $500
```

### Backdoor Roth Process
```
1. Contribute $7,000 to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Convert to Roth IRA immediately
3. If no other IRA balance: 100% tax-free conversion
4. If existing balance: Pro-rata rule applies
```

### Mega Backdoor Roth
```
Regular 401(k) limit: $23,500
After-tax contribution room: $46,500 ($70,000 - $23,500)
Convert after-tax to Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA
Total Roth potential: $70,000/year
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No Backdoor Roth**: Check IRA balance and understanding
2. **Missing 401(k)**: Verify ex_q1 = "Yes"
3. **Wrong allocation**: Check total percentage calculation
4. **No Roth vehicles**: Verify income and phase-out

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('4_Roth_Reclaimer')
showVehicleOrder('4_Roth_Reclaimer')
traceAllocation('4_Roth_Reclaimer')
