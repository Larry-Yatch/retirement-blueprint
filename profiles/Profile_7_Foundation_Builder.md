# Profile 7: Foundation Builder

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Standard investors building their retirement foundation without specific circumstances that trigger other profiles. This is the default profile for most W-2 employees with employer benefits who are establishing good savings habits.

### Core Challenge
Creating a balanced retirement strategy that maximizes employer benefits, takes advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, and builds a solid foundation for long-term wealth accumulation.

### Key Differentiator
This is the ONLY profile that dynamically integrates employer 401(k) benefits into the vehicle order, making it the most flexible profile for standard employees with varying benefit packages.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
8 (Default profile - lowest priority, catches all users not matching other profiles)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
// Default profile - assigned when no other profile conditions are met
if (no other profile conditions met) {
    return '7_Foundation_Builder';
}
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Young Professional**: First job with 401(k), building habits
- **Mid-Career Employee**: Steady income, employer benefits, family goals
- **Career Changer**: New job, evaluating benefit options
- **Dual Income Household**: Coordinating two employer plans

'7_Foundation_Builder': {
    48: 'ex_q1',  // employer 401k

    51: 'ex_q4'   // roth 401k option
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- None currently identified
- Form mapping tested and working

## üéØ Vehicle Priority Order

### Education Domain

#### Base Order
1. **Combined CESA** - $167/child/month
   - Why: Tax-free education savings
   - Conditions: Only if has children

2. **Education Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for education
   - Conditions: Always included

### Health Domain

#### Base Order
1. **HSA** - Individual: $358/mo, Family: $713/mo
   - Why: Triple tax advantage
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible
   - Catch-up: +$83/mo if age 55+

2. **Health Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Overflow vehicle for health
   - Conditions: Always included

### Retirement Domain

#### Base Order (Before Employer 401k Addition)
1. **Roth IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: Tax-free growth, default for younger savers
   - Conditions: If income < phase-out

2. **Traditional IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: Tax deduction option
   - Conditions: Always available

3. **Backdoor Roth IRA** - $583/mo ($667/mo if 50+)
   - Why: High earner Roth access
   - Conditions: If income > phase-out

4. **HSA** - (retirement portion)
   - Why: Triple tax advantage
   - Conditions: If HSA eligible

5. **Family Bank** - Unlimited
   - Why: Final overflow
   - Conditions: Always included

### Dynamic Modifications

#### Employer 401(k) Integration
When employer offers 401(k):
1. **401(k) Match** - Inserted FIRST (free money)
2. **401(k) Employee** - Inserted after match
3. Order becomes: Match ‚Üí HSA ‚Üí 401(k) ‚Üí IRAs ‚Üí Family Bank

#### Match Calculation Examples
- **"50% up to 6%"**: On $75k salary = $375/mo to get $187.50 match
- **"100% up to 3%"**: On $75k salary = $187.50/mo to get full match
- **"Dollar for dollar up to $2,000"**: $167/mo to get full $2,000/yr

### Final Order Examples

#### Scenario: Young Professional with 401(k) Match
**Education Domain:**
1. Education Bank - Unlimited (no kids yet)

**Health Domain:**
1. HSA - $358/mo (individual)
2. Health Bank - Unlimited

**Retirement Domain:**
1. 401(k) Match - $375/mo (to get 50% match on 6%)
2. HSA - $358/mo (retirement portion)
3. 401(k) Roth - $1,958/mo
4. Roth IRA - $583/mo
5. Traditional IRA - $583/mo

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **401(k) Beyond Match**: Only adds match, not full contribution
2. **Auto-Escalation**: No progressive increase recommendations
3. **Emergency Fund**: No validation of emergency savings
4. **Debt Consideration**: No debt payoff prioritization

### Future Enhancements
1. **Full 401(k) Integration**: Add employee contributions beyond match
2. **Smart Escalation**: Annual increase recommendations
3. **Holistic Planning**: Include emergency fund and debt
4. **Spouse Coordination**: Optimize dual-income strategies
5. **Target-Date Guidance**: Investment selection help

### Tuning Checklist
- ‚úÖ Review current vehicle order
- ‚úÖ Verify all universal functions used
- ‚úÖ Check form question mapping
- ‚úÖ Test with edge cases
- ‚úÖ Validate catch-up logic
- ‚úÖ Confirm phase-out handling
- ‚úÖ Test employer benefits integration
- ‚úÖ Verify tax preference ordering

## üìä Common Calculations

### Employer Match Optimization
```
Salary: $75,000
Match: 50% up to 6%

Employee contribution: $75,000 √ó 6% = $4,500/year ($375/mo)
Employer match: $4,500 √ó 50% = $2,250/year ($187.50/mo)
Total benefit: $6,750/year ($562.50/mo)
```

### Roth vs Traditional Decision (Young Saver)
```
Age: 25
Current tax bracket: 22%
Expected retirement bracket: 24%+
Years to retirement: 40

Decision: Prioritize Roth
- Pay 22% tax now
- 40 years of tax-free growth
- Tax-free in potentially higher bracket
```

### Phase-Out Calculation
```
Single filer income: $155,000
Roth IRA phase-out range: $146,000-$161,000
Position in range: ($155,000-$146,000)/($161,000-$146,000) = 60%
Reduction: $7,000 √ó 60% = $4,200
Allowed contribution: $7,000 - $4,200 = $2,800/year
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No 401(k) vehicles**: Check ex_q1 = "Yes"
2. **Wrong match amount**: Verify ex_q3 format
3. **Missing Backdoor Roth**: Check income level
4. **No HSA**: Verify HSA_Eligibility field

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('7_Foundation_Builder')
showVehicleOrder('7_Foundation_Builder')
traceAllocation('7_Foundation_Builder')
testEmployerIntegration()
```
