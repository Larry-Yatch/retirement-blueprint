# Profile 2: ROBS Curious - Current Implementation

## Profile Identity
**Who they are:** Someone interested in ROBS (Rollover as Business Startup) but hasn't implemented it yet. They're exploring using retirement funds to start/fund a business.

**Core Challenge:** They might be either:
- Currently a W-2 employee planning to start a business
- Already self-employed but haven't set up ROBS yet
- Both (side business while employed)

## Current Implementation Status ✅

### 1. Dynamic Vehicle Selection
The profile correctly adapts vehicles based on employment status:
- **W-2 Employee**: Gets employer 401(k) options (no Solo 401(k))
- **Self-Employed**: Gets Solo 401(k) options  
- **Both**: Gets both sets of vehicles with proper coordination

### 2. Simplified Solo 401(k) Approach
Instead of complex entity type questions, we use a simplified approach:
- Ask for total business savings capacity (one number)
- Ask if spouse works in business
- Apply waterfall logic: Fill employee bucket first, remainder to employer
- Conservative 20% calculation works for all entity types
- Clear disclaimers to consult tax advisor

### 3. Current Questions & Mapping

**Extra Questions:**
1. Does your employer offer a 401(k)? → ex_q1
2. Does your employer match? → ex_q2  
3. Match percentage? → ex_q3
4. Roth 401(k) option? → ex_q4
5. Rollover balance for ROBS? → ex_q5
6. Annual business savings capacity? → ex_q6
7. Spouse in business? → ex_q7

**Form Mapping (FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING):**
```javascript
'2_ROBS_Curious': {
  9: 'ex_q1',   // employer 401k
  10: 'ex_q2',  // employer match  
  12: 'ex_q3',  // match percentage
  11: 'ex_q4',  // roth option
  7: 'ex_q5',   // rollover balance
  8: 'ex_q6',   // business savings capacity
  13: 'ex_q7'   // spouse in business (at end of form)
}
```

### 4. Vehicle Priority Order

**W-2 Employee Only:**
1. Employer 401(k) Match (if available) - FREE MONEY
2. HSA (if eligible) - Triple tax advantage
3. Employer 401(k) Employee contributions
4. Traditional IRA - For future ROBS
5. Roth IRA (or Backdoor if phased out)
6. Family Bank - Final overflow

**Self-Employed Only:**
1. HSA (if eligible)
2. Solo 401(k) – Roth/Traditional (order based on tax preference)
3. Solo 401(k) – Employer (if business savings > 0)
4. Traditional IRA - For future ROBS
5. Roth IRA (or Backdoor if phased out)
6. Family Bank - Final overflow

**Both W-2 and Self-Employed:**
Combines both strategies with appropriate limit coordination

### 5. Key Features Implemented

✅ **Universal Functions**: All used (HSA, CESA, Roth phase-out, tax preferences)
✅ **Catch-up Contributions**: Age 50+ limits applied correctly
✅ **Employer 401(k) Integration**: Via addEmployer401kVehicles()
✅ **Spouse Support**: Doubles Solo 401(k) capacity
✅ **Traditional IRA**: Always included for ROBS planning
✅ **No Taxable Brokerage**: Flows directly to Family Bank
✅ **Tax Preference Logic**: Adjusts vehicle order

## Calculation Examples

### Single Person, $100k Business Savings:
- Employee: $23,000 (fills first)
- Employer: $46,000 (remainder up to $69k total)
- Total: $69,000

### Couple in Business, $150k Savings:
- Employee: $46,000 (2 × $23k)
- Employer: $92,000 (remainder)
- Total: $138,000 (2 × $69k)

### With Catch-up (50+), Single:
- Employee: $30,500
- Employer: $46,000  
- Total: $76,500

## Test Results ✅
All test scenarios pass:
- Self-employed calculations correct
- W-2 employee gets proper vehicles
- Mixed employment handled correctly
- Spouse multiplier working
- Phase-outs applied properly

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. **Entity Type**: Uses conservative 20% for all (C-Corps could use 25%)
2. **ROBS Timeline**: No question about when planning to execute
3. **Risk Assessment**: ROBS is high-risk, no risk tolerance check
4. **State Taxes**: Not considered in vehicle ordering

### Potential Future Enhancements:
1. Add entity type question for precise calculations
2. Add ROBS timeline question
3. Add current retirement balance question
4. Consider state tax optimization
5. Add educational notes about ROBS requirements
