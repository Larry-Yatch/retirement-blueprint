# Profile 7 (Foundation Builder) Test Validation Report - Version 2

## Executive Summary

Profile 7 "Foundation Builder" has been updated with corrected form mapping for employer 401(k) questions. The FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING now correctly maps form positions 44-47 to ex_q1-4, which should resolve the issue where 401(k) vehicles were generated but not allocated.

## Changes Made

### Form Mapping Fix
```javascript
'7_Foundation_Builder': {
  44: 'ex_q1',   // employer 401k
  45: 'ex_q2',   // employer match
  46: 'ex_q3',   // match percentage
  47: 'ex_q4'    // roth 401k option
}
```

This fix ensures that employer 401(k) data from the form is correctly mapped to the ex_q columns in the Working Sheet.

## Expected vs Previous Results

- Proper priority order maintained

## Recommendations

### If Tests Pass:
1. Profile 7 is ready for production
2. Document the fix in release notes
3. Test remaining profiles with 401(k)

### If Tests Fail:
1. Check ex_q column values in Working Sheet
2. Verify form positions are correct
3. Debug `addEmployer401kVehicles` function
4. Check for data type mismatches

## Conclusion

With the FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING fix, Profile 7 should now correctly:
- Read employer 401(k) data from form submissions
- Generate appropriate 401(k) vehicles
- Allocate funds to those vehicles based on priority

The profile represents the most common use case (standard employees with 401k) and is critical for the system's success. This fix should restore full functionality.
