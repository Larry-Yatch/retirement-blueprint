# Profile 2: ROBS Curious

## 🎯 Profile Identity

### Target User
Someone interested in ROBS (Rollover as Business Startup) but hasn't implemented it yet. They're exploring using retirement funds to start or fund a business while maintaining current employment or self-employment status.

### Core Challenge
Balancing current retirement savings strategies while preparing for a future ROBS implementation. Must maintain flexibility for different employment scenarios (W-2, self-employed, or both).

### Key Differentiator
Unlike Profile 1 (ROBS In Use), these users are in the planning phase. They need traditional retirement vehicles while preserving the ability to roll funds into a future ROBS structure.

## 📊 Classification Logic

### Priority Order
2 (Second in classification hierarchy after ROBS In Use)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (hasBusinessEntity && hasOldRetirementAccounts && hasSignificantPlan && 
    isFullTime && (age >= 21 && age < 70)) {
    return '2_ROBS_Curious';
}
```

### Common Scenarios
- **W-2 Employee Planning Exit**: Working corporate job, planning business launch
- **Self-Employed Considering ROBS**: Already in business, exploring ROBS funding
- **Dual Income Transition**: Spouse working while planning business venture
- **Side Business Growth**: Part-time business ready to go full-time with ROBS

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### Current State
- ✅ Profile Helper Function

## 📝 Form Configuration

### Phase 2 Extra Questions
1. **ex_q1**: Does your employer offer a 401(k) retirement plan? → Employer plan availability
2. **ex_q2**: Does your employer match your 401(k) contributions? → Match availability
3. **ex_q3**: What percentage does your employer match? → Match calculation
4. **ex_q4**: Does your employer 401(k) plan have a Roth option? → Roth 401(k) availability
5. **ex_q5**: What is your current retirement account balance available for rollover? → ROBS planning
6. **ex_q6**: How much can your business contribute annually to retirement? → Solo 401(k) sizing
7. **ex_q7**: Does your spouse work in the business? → Doubles Solo 401(k) capacity

### Form Mapping (FORM_EX_Q_MAPPING)
```javascript
'2_ROBS_Curious': {
    46: 'ex_q1',  // employer 401k
    47: 'ex_q2',  // employer match
    48: 'ex_q3',  // match percentage
    49: 'ex_q4',  // roth option
    44: 'ex_q5',  // rollover balance
    45: 'ex_q6',  // business savings capacity
    50: 'ex_q7'   // spouse in business
}
```

## 📈 Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations
1. **Entity Type Assumption**: Uses conservative 20% for all business types (C-Corps could use 25%)
2. **ROBS Timeline**: No question about when planning to execute ROBS
3. **Risk Assessment**: ROBS is high-risk, no risk tolerance check
4. **State Taxes**: Not considered in vehicle ordering

### Future Enhancements
1. **Entity Type Question**: Allow precise employer contribution calculations
2. **ROBS Timeline**: Adjust strategy based on implementation timeframe
3. **Rollover Coordination**: Better integration with existing balance data
4. **State Tax Optimization**: Consider state-specific benefits
5. **ROBS Education**: Add guidance about requirements and risks

### Tuning Checklist
- ✅ Review current vehicle order
- ✅ Verify all universal functions used
- ✅ Check form question mapping
- ✅ Test with edge cases
- ✅ Validate catch-up logic
- ✅ Confirm phase-out handling
- ✅ Test employer benefits integration
- ✅ Verify tax preference ordering

## 📊 Common Calculations

### Solo 401(k) with Business Savings
```
Input: $100,000 annual business savings, single person
Employee contribution: min($23,000, $100,000) = $23,000
Employer contribution: min(20% × $100,000, $46,000) = $20,000
Total: $43,000/year = $3,583/mo
```

### Solo 401(k) with Spouse
```
Input: $150,000 annual business savings, both spouses in business
Employee contribution: 2 × $23,000 = $46,000
Employer contribution: $150,000 - $46,000 = $104,000 (capped at $92,000)
Total: $138,000/year = $11,500/mo
```

### Employer Match Calculation
```
Input: $120,000 income, 50% match up to 6%
Employee contribution needed: $120,000 × 6% = $7,200/year
Employer match: $7,200 × 50% = $3,600/year
Total with match: $10,800/year = $900/mo
```

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Solo 401(k)**: Check Work_Situation includes "Self-employed"
2. **No employer match**: Verify ex_q1 = "Yes" and ex_q2 = "Yes"
3. **Wrong Solo 401(k) amount**: Check ex_q6 has valid number
4. **Missing spouse multiplier**: Verify ex_q7 = "Yes"

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('2_ROBS_Curious')
showVehicleOrder('2_ROBS_Curious')
traceAllocation('2_ROBS_Curious')
testFormMapping('2_ROBS_Curious')
