# Profile 9: Late Stage Growth

## 🎯 Profile Identity

### Target User
Individuals near retirement (age 55+ or retiring within 5 years) with substantial savings accumulated who need strategies for wealth preservation, tax-efficient withdrawals, and potential estate planning. May be interested in alternative investments.

### Core Challenge
Transitioning from accumulation to preservation/distribution phase while maximizing catch-up contributions, planning for RMDs, optimizing Social Security timing, and potentially exploring alternative investments for diversification.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike the Catch-Up profile focused on aggressive saving, this profile balances final accumulation with pre-retirement planning, withdrawal strategies, and wealth preservation for a secure retirement and potential legacy.

## 📊 Classification Logic

### Priority Order
5 (After business profiles but takes precedence over general Catch-Up profile)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (age >= 55 || String(nearRetire).startsWith('Yes')) {
    return '9_Late_Stage_Growth';
}
// Note: Takes precedence over Catch-Up profile despite similar age
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Early Retiree**: Age 55-59, need income bridge strategies
- **Executive**: Deferred comp, stock options to manage
- **Business Sale**: Lump sum to allocate efficiently
- **Inheritance Planning**: Optimizing for next generation

## 📈 Optimization & Tuning

### Tuning Checklist
- ✅ Review current vehicle order

- [ ] Include Social Security planning
- [ ] Test withdrawal strategies
- ✅ Verify catch-up calculations

## 📊 Common Calculations

### Retirement Timeline Planning
```
Age 58, Retire at 62:
Years to Medicare: 7 (age 65)
Bridge Period: 3 years (62-65)
HSA needed: $25,000-40,000
Social Security: Delay to 70 for 24% boost
```

### RMD Projections
```
Age 73 RMD (new SECURE 2.0 age):
$1,000,000 balance ÷ 26.5 = $37,736/year
Tax planning: Convert to Roth before RMDs
Consider QCDs at 70.5 for charity
```

### Estate Planning with Roth
```
Traditional IRA: Heirs pay tax on distributions
Roth IRA: Tax-free to heirs, 10-year rule
Strategy: Convert Traditional to Roth
Pay tax now at known rates
```

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Missing catch-up**: Verify age >= 50
2. **No employer match**: Check employment status
3. **Wrong phase-out**: Verify income level
4. **Missing HSA catch-up**: Check age >= 55

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('9_Late_Stage_Growth')
showVehicleOrder('9_Late_Stage_Growth')
traceAllocation('9_Late_Stage_Growth')
projectRMDs(currentBalance, age)
