# Profile 6: Catch Up

## üéØ Profile Identity

### Target User
Individuals age 50+ who feel behind on retirement savings and want aggressive, tax-smart catch-up planning. They have access to enhanced contribution limits and need to maximize every opportunity to build retirement security.

### Core Challenge
Making up for lost time by maximizing all available catch-up contributions across multiple vehicles while optimizing tax strategy for both current deductions and future retirement income.

### Key Differentiator
This profile specifically leverages age-based catch-up provisions across 401(k), IRA, and HSA vehicles, providing 30-50% higher contribution capacity than younger savers.

## üìä Classification Logic

### Priority Order
6 (After business and specialized profiles, but before general age-based profiles)

### Classification Criteria
```javascript
// From classifyClientProfileFromWorkingSheet()
if (age >= 50 && catchUpFeeling === 'Yes') {
    return '6_Catch_Up';
}
// Note: Takes precedence over Bracket Strategist but not over business-related profiles
```

### Common Scenarios
- **Late Career Professional**: High income, maximizing final years
- **Empty Nester**: Kids through college, redirecting to retirement
- **Inheritance Recipient**: Windfall to allocate efficiently
- **Divorced Individual**: Rebuilding retirement after split

## üìà Optimization & Tuning

### Current Limitations

### Future Enhancements
1. **RMD Calculator**: Project future required distributions
2. **Social Security Optimizer**: Coordinate with claiming strategy
3. **Medicare IRMAA**: Manage income to avoid surcharges

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No catch-up vehicles**: Check age >= 50
2. **Wrong catch-up amounts**: Verify age brackets
3. **Missing HSA catch-up**: Check age >= 55
4. **No employer match**: Verify ex_q1 and ex_q2

### Debug Commands
```javascript
diagnoseProfile('6_Catch_Up')
showVehicleOrder('6_Catch_Up')
traceAllocation('6_Catch_Up')
checkCatchUpEligibility()
